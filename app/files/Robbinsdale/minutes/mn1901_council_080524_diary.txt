Speaker A:
Should say, and that's approval as to what tonight's agenda is. And I'm making sure that we're going to be more live here. And I guess we are. The staff has asked that we change a particular item, new business. A resolution adopting a street reconstruction plan to public hearing a. Because that does have to be a public hearing. I've asked that we. Oh, I've asked that we discuss making a certain day to honor a 100 year old business in town sites auto care, so that maybe we should put under other business c right before administrative reports. So. Okay. So with those changes, is there anything else that the staff has that we should take note of as far as your recommended agenda?
Speaker B:
Yes. Thank you, mayor. Members of the council, along with those items, I'd like to add, too. Also, the first amendment is to other business item a. So we're adding the voucher disbursement report. We have a printed version if people want to view it tonight, and the council was sent it earlier today. The second addition would be to consent item l. There's additional list of licenses that the council will approve. They were also sent to council earlier and are printed out if people want to view them. So those are my two additions.
Speaker A:
Okay. Those items are on the agenda. They're just different materials, is that right?
Speaker B:
That's correct. There's. Everything is already on the agenda. For my additions, there's just additional things to approve.
Speaker A:
Council members, anything you want to add to the agenda. Is there anybody that has a motion with regard to having the agenda as presented now?
Speaker C:
Yes, Mister mayor. I move that we approve tonight's agenda with the amendments noted.
Speaker A:
Second, all those in favor signify by saying aye.
Speaker C:
A aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. Elizabeth? Say nor nay. That motion carries. We've approved what tonight's agenda is. Next, we have the consent agenda. Pursuant to council rules, one motion, non debatable, will approve the recommendation noted. Any member of the council may withdraw for separate action any item from the consent agenda. Such items removed from the consent agenda shall be considered immediately following approval of the balance of the consent agenda. Does anyone have. Anyone in the city council have anything that they wish to withdraw from the consent agenda? I wish to withdraw f appointment of Aaron Sparks as award to parks, recreation and forestry commissioner. Anybody else have anything else? Anybody have a motion hearing?
Speaker D:
None. I move that we approve the consent agenda with item f removed.
Speaker A:
Second, all those in favor signify by saying aye. All those opposed say no or nay. That motion carries. So what did we approve on the consent agenda? We approved various city council minutes, minutes from the June 4, 2024. Regular meeting and the work session of the council of June 11 and the work session from the council. From the. From the city council work session of July 9. We approved a receipt of the Human Rights Commission. Minutes of May 23, 2024. Approved a bunch of block party requests for national night out, which incidentally, is tomorrow. And please go to your block party if you have one near you. And the state aid closures that go along with that. We approve that. We accepted a quote for bituminous mill and overlay project. And we approved or received both the deputy registrar's monthly financial statements and the Robinsdale wine and spirits monthly financial statements. We approved various credit cardinal charges and payment. We approved certain licenses with the additions that our city clerk told us about. We accepted a donation of fire suppression tools from Minneapolis Cataract and Brumsville Masonic Lodge. And we approved a joint powers agreement for continued participation in the Shingle watershed Creek Watershed Management Commission. So going to F. Which is appointment of Aaron Sparks as ward two parks and forestry commissioner. That was withdrawn by me. I withdraw these things to just publicly thank people for volunteering to serve on a commission at no cost and at expense of their own personal time. And I am, you know, hoping and I'm sure we are going to appoint a ward two Parkwick and forestry commissioner that's very qualified. Aaron has a b's in community development from St. Cloud University and some professional credentials in that serves on the board of directors for Mid America Economic Development Council and vice chair of certain other board of directors. Active member of membership committee on Economic Development indicated why participation would be a good thing. And so I think we're very fortunate to have this applicant and so is there anybody that would like to move to appoint. Aaron Sparks has award tube, parks, recreation and forestry commissioner.
Speaker C:
So moved.
Speaker A:
Second, any comment? All those in favor signify by saying aye. All opposed say no or nay. And that item carries. Next, we have a presentation with regard to a donation from the Minneapolis Cataract and Robbinsdale Masonic Lodge. A thing that we accepted on consent agenda item M. Is there somebody that's giving us a presentation on that? You don't have to tell us your address, but your name would be a good thing.
Speaker E:
My name is Andrew hall, member of Cataract lodge number two in Minneapolis.
Speaker F:
My name is Troy Lauman, member of Compass Lodge here in Robbinsdale. My name's staten Berg, member of Cataract Lodge number two, Minneapolis.
Speaker A:
Well, okay, tell us what, what you did like. What's the donation and how does this work?
Speaker E:
Absolutely.
Speaker A:
Thank you.
Speaker E:
All for allowing us to be here and allowing us the time. On behalf of the members of Cataract, lodge number two encompass lodge number 265, ancient, free and accepted masons and Minnesota Masonic charities, it is our pleasure to present ten fire suppression tools. Go ahead and open it up. Ten fire suppression tools. To Chief Foley and Captain elder of the Robbinsdale Police Department. I actually met Chief Patrick eight years ago. His younger brother Sean and I worked together at a local restaurant in Edina. And Sean made it part of his annual bonus structure to be able to donate a taco bar to the Robbinsdale police department for his brother.
Speaker A:
Very smart person.
Speaker E:
Eight years later, myself and the members of Cataract Lodge, we did a taco bar fundraiser and we raised $7,500 in order to provide your police department with these life saving tools. I'm here with Dayton Berg. He's the most recent past grandmasters of Masons of Minnesota. He's the championship champion of this program for the state of Minnesota. And overall, we've donated. Masons of Minnesota have donated almost a thousand of these. So this will be 1010 more. And I'm here with Troy Lawman. He's the worshipful master, current sitting worshipful master of Compass Lodge. Troy, would you like to say a few words?
Speaker A:
Yes.
Speaker F:
As Andy had said, thank you for having us here this evening. It's an honor to be here with you all. If you may recall, several decades ago, the Minnesota Freemasons had a project with partnering with local law enforcement in the prevention of missing children and missing persons. And that was the project they had been doing with local law enforcement several decades ago. I actually got to be a participant when I was a kid attending new Hope elementary school, which is pretty cool. The newest venture with Minnesota Freemasons is the fire suppression tool, which we are very excited about. And compass lodge here in Robbinsdale is directly involved in that new venture with the Minnesota Freemasons. And we are very excited for the opportunity to partner with the local police and fire teams here in Robbinsdale to utilize these fire suppression tools and hopefully save some lives. Dayton, did you have some other words to share? I can.
Speaker A:
Mister mayor, council, get right up next to the microphone, please.
Speaker F:
Oh, you want to hear me?
Speaker A:
I really do.
Speaker F:
Okay. This tool came to my awareness two and a half years ago at a conference in Milwaukee. And do you have the video? Which button? I suggest you all watch this video because it speaks volumes on what this tool can do.
Speaker A:
So while Chase is hooking up that video, maybe how much does one of these cost? Then you're providing ten. So that'll be easy math to figure out what you're donating.
Speaker F:
Well, the company that's the direct distributor, cut us and other law enforcements and fire departments in Wisconsin and other states a deal. This, if you was to go to the company, would be $1,200. Okay. They gave us a price of $900 in which the Lodz has come up with 300 charities. Minnesota Masonic charities. I'm sure you've heard about the Masonic Children's hospital and the cancer center.
Speaker A:
Yes, they're all part of this. I've had a granddaughter treated there for cancer.
Speaker F:
Everything went well?
Speaker A:
It did. They were great.
Speaker F:
Great. And.
Speaker G:
Where was I?
Speaker A:
That's two thirds.
Speaker F:
Grand Lodge kicks in 300. And they have held that price ever since our first order a year ago last April. They've been really good at allowing us to buy one at $900. This video really tells a story. And I can tell you there have been four of these deployed in the state of Minnesota. And after you see this video, I can also tell you they succeeded in what they said they'd do. Please, chief, make sure you register these things because that's when you're warranted. These are warrantied for 15 years. And we've done a couple field demonstrations and the company sent us some that were at 14 614. Seven. And every one of them deployed it just like a new one. It's amazing. And the company, the mixies are nether ones, just so you know. Want to play that, please?
Speaker A:
No. I see. I'm not sure which one it actually.
Speaker H:
Is on the internal temperature of a structure fire can reach up to 1500 degrees. By pulling the pin on this device and throwing it in, the temperature of a fire can drop 1000 degrees in just 35 seconds. 35 life saving seconds. That was made possible by your lodge, your brothers, your dedication to serving your community. Freemasons take an obligation to support those around them and give back in a multitude of ways. From individual efforts to local community drive to statewide initiatives. Through Minnesota Masonic charities, Grant Lodge and Minnesota Masonic Charities have partnered for a project that will save lives and promote mainstream in the community. It's time that we did something differently to leverage the support we've provided for many years. This is an opportunity to become actively engaged in your community.
Speaker A:
In 2022, Wisconsin Masons launched a campaign like this one and eight units were.
Speaker H:
Deployed saving lives and property damage.
Speaker A:
This opportunity for your lodge is very.
Speaker H:
Simple and requires minimal cost and effort.
Speaker A:
Find a first responding agency to donate to reach out to that agency with.
Speaker H:
What youd like to donate and when. Tell the media what youre donating to.
Speaker A:
Who host the donation event and take pictures to share what you've done.
Speaker H:
Together, we have created materials for you to use, videos to share, email templates for media requests to tips on how to host your donation event successfully. We are here to make this as simple as possible for your lodge to have an even greater impact on your community. I can promise you, by creating relationships with your local media, there's a much larger chance they will respond to you for other events that your lodge is hosting. I look forward to sharing the successes of this campaign with everyone. And we are here if you have any questions.
Speaker A:
Thank you. So, by virtue of the fact that we have a masonic lodge in Robbinsdale, you are helping our community by doing this. So I see Captain Elder is here, and maybe he wants to say something about this donation.
Speaker G:
Good evening, your honor and council members. I'm John Elder, captain of the Robinsdale Police Department. We would like to thank the Freemasons for their work and their generosity in the donation of ten fire suppression systems that our police officers can carry in their patrol vehicles. Officers are often first responders to these incidents and can arrive several minutes prior to the fire department. Providing them the tools to safely knock down or knock out fires is paramount to saving lives and property. On behalf of Chief Foley and the members of the Robbinsdale Police Department, we thank you for accepting this donation.
Speaker A:
Thank you. And I noticed that your video said it was important to get photos, so why don't you go ahead and line. I didn't wear a suit today. Captain Elder did. I think he'd more appropriate to be in the picture. So why don't you line up somewhere and have a picture right now? That's okay. It'll look better with you. Had I known. Look bright eyed, Aaron, you might be in the picture. I was hoping to get some of.
Speaker H:
You in the picture.
Speaker A:
Yeah, yeah, that's okay. Do it. Thank you. All right. Well, yeah.
Speaker G:
And for the council, I did meet with the individual from 47th and 81, and I will see that we are getting extra enforcement in that area to address concerns very quick.
Speaker A:
Thank you so much.
Speaker G:
Thank you so much.
Speaker A:
All right. Well, that was a. That was a fun item, actually, to have people that are helping society come in here out of their own goodwill and leverage their. Their ability to get things done by getting $1,200 units, by contributing 300 and getting two more people to get there, two more agencies or charities to give 300 more each. And so that was great. We get $9,000 of things which are arguably $12,000 worth of fire suppression units, and we didn't pay anything for it. It was only a good deed doer that that helped us. So thank you so much. Next item on the agenda is the public hearings, and we do have a public hearing. Did new business move to here? The resolution for adopting the street reconstruction plan? Public hearing a that's okay. So we have DEA Tahoon, our finance director, to talk to us about. They're asking us to adopt a resolution for street reconstruction and authorizing a preliminary bond sale. So go ahead, dia this, by the way, this is on pages 85 through 118 of our materials. Good evening, Mister mayor. Councilmember, as a part of 2024 pond, we are required to do resolution adopting.
Speaker G:
A the street reconstruction plan.
Speaker A:
So we.
Speaker G:
Can facilitate the pond sale. We did the CIP in the previous.
Speaker A:
Session, and this part for the street.
Speaker G:
Reconstruction, we have Chris Hogan from Becker Tilly. We'll go through the process where we are when we accept that we will receive the fund.
Speaker I:
Thank you, mayor and members of the council. Chris Hogan here from Baker Tilley, serving as the city's municipal advisor. Like Dia said tonight, the public hearing is in regards to the street reconstruction plan and street issuance of street reconstruction bonds. That's just a piece of the bond issue that the city will consider a resolution this evening as well. That's all I have to say about the public hearing. Oh, you want to talk about. I was going to talk about that with the bond part.
Speaker G:
Mister mayor, council, maybe if I can get a bit of clarity. We do have a two for one here with two resolutions asking for, asking for your approval. But to first hold the public hearing is our recommendation. If you want to open that up, take feedback, close the public hearing, and then staff would be happy to jump in further if appetite of the council.
Speaker A:
So this first resolution is to just adopt a. Well, I'm sorry, the public hearing is for the purpose of determining whether we should adopt the street reconstruction plan and authorize the preliminary bond sale.
Speaker I:
That's correct, yeah.
Speaker A:
And there are like, there are at least three parts to this bond.
Speaker I:
So the street reconstruction plan that you're considering as part of the public hearing is for three, three streets. It's the 41st Avenue, Oakdale Avenue and York Avenue. And you're setting a not to exceed borrowing for the street reconstruction portion of this bond issue at $1,650,000.
Speaker A:
Okay. And then later on the agenda, there's another resolution authorizing the sale of general obligation bonds in the amount of $3,620,000. For other purposes, which I'm trying to find a synopsis of the other purposes. Maybe you're speak to that.
Speaker I:
Yeah.
Speaker A:
Well, why don't you? Because if I was going to talk at the public hearing, I would want to know what's the whole package here.
Speaker I:
Absolutely.
Speaker A:
Okay.
Speaker I:
So the bond issue that you referred to is a bond issue where the student construction portion of the bond is just one of four portions. So, like you did the capital improvement plan portion that was considered last month, the public hearing was held for that. And then there's a portion that's equipment certificates. So there's a list of capital equipment that the city will be purchasing, and then there's a small. There's a portion that's water related, and that that portion is. I can tell you how much that is. Utility portion. It's related to the sewer improvements related to the 41st Avenue reconstruction. So together, those four different purposes are kind of like separate bond issues, but we're able to put those all together into one bond issue to have efficiency of bond issuance. The issue size right now is set at 3,000,520. There's a not to exceed par amount. And that's what we're considering with the resolution today, is that you would have said a not to exceed par amount of 3,620,000. And that bond sale. The bond sale is scheduled to happen on September 10. In between now and then, there'll be a rating conference that will hold with S and P, the city, and Baker Tilly, and that rating call is scheduled for August 20. Currently, the city holds aa plus rating with S and P, and the bonds are structured, like I said, as for purpose. Overall, the repayment term is for ten years.
Speaker A:
Okay, so we've had a public hearing on all but the ones that we're talking about specifically at this public hearing, which is the street reconstruction plan, and our intent to authorize a preliminary bond sale with regard to that. So is there anyone in the public that wants to. I declare the public hearing open. Is there anyone in the public that wants to talk to the city council about this particular proposed adoption of a street reconstruction plan authorizing the preliminary bond sale hearing? None. Is there a motion to close the public hearing?
Speaker D:
So moved.
Speaker A:
Second, all those in favor say aye.
Speaker D:
Hi.
Speaker A:
I was saying no or nay. That motion carries. So Chris Hohigan and Tim Sandvik have done a great job explaining that, because nobody wanted to talk about that. So then the next thing is. Well, the next thing, it's new business item a, which is moved to public hearings. So we're being asked to adopt a street reconstruction plan, providing preliminary approval for the issuance of bonds they're under, and taking other actions in connection there with, as indicated by a resolution on pages 86 through 88 of our materials, which is really only a three page resolution. Does somebody want to make that motion?
Speaker D:
Yes, Mister Mayor, I'll move that we approve the. Let's see. I'll waive the move that we waive the reading and order the adoption of the resolution, adopting a street reconstruction plan, providing preliminary approval for the issuance of bonds there under, and taking other actions in connection there with the proposed aggregate principal amount of $1 million $650,000.
Speaker A:
2Nd okay, so this is a motion just for that part, that 1,650,000. When I say just, that's a lot of money, but that's what this is for. Any more discussion? All those in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. That motion carries three to nothing. Next, we're being asked at pages 89 through.
Speaker D:
Mister Mayor, I'll make another motion that will waive the reading in order. Adoption of the. Unless you're you wanting to do the other one too?
Speaker A:
Yes.
Speaker D:
Okay, sorry, maybe I messed up your flow here. Did you want to talk about it on the one on 89?
Speaker A:
No, Chris talked about it. I think I'll go. Do you have more to say?
Speaker I:
No, not really. But if there's any questions. I do want to reiterate that the bonds as a whole is 3,520,000 general obligation bonds, series 2024 A, which a portion of. I already said the student reconstruction is just one piece of core. So any other questions on that?
Speaker D:
Okay, thank you. No. Yes, then I'll thank you for that.
Speaker A:
Just a minute. City manager has something Mister mayor council.
Speaker G:
Either after the motion or before. Just a quick tidbit.
Speaker A:
Go ahead.
Speaker G:
Mister Mayor council. Thank you. I just wanted to point out this process has been a bit of unusual compared to what we normally would do, especially for larger street projects. We would order the work by way of resolution, and if we were to do bonding, whether for this type of work or through capital, that issuance typically falls earlier in the year. Just maybe for those watching at home. A reminder that the capital process that was done earlier in the year and the motion for ordering the actual reconstruction plan didn't meet the standards to go through this process. So that's why this is happening this late in the year. Just pointing that out in that normally this happens a lot earlier, in case there were some that might be wondering.
Speaker D:
That makes sense. All right, so I will move to waive the reading and order the adoption of the resolution authorizing the sale of general obligation bonds, series 2024 A, in the maximum aggregate principal amount of. Of $3,620,000, fixing their form and specifications, directing their execution and delivery, providing for their payment, and establishing a pricing committee.
Speaker C:
Second.
Speaker A:
Okay, so on this resolution, I'm going to just try to clarify whether the 1,620,000, 601,165,000 was the last one was part of. Is part of this resolution also?
Speaker I:
That is correct, yep.
Speaker A:
So we're not having a situation where we're having 1,650,000 from the previous resolution and 3,620,000 from this resolution, for a total of 5.5 million. This is a total of 3,620,000?
Speaker I:
That is correct. Including the street reconstruction.
Speaker A:
Yeah, it kind of makes it sound like we just did two things, but the one thing we did just a few minutes ago is also contained in this one.
Speaker I:
Correct.
Speaker A:
Okay. All right. Anybody else have anything? And you indicated before for efficiency, we're combining these for efficiency. And one of the things you meant by that was it saves us money because we don't have to pay for certain things twice.
Speaker I:
Right. You're not bonding for more than one bond issue, which would be additional cost of issuance, and then there's efficiency on marketing it and pricing. So underwriters who purchase the bonds like bigger transactions as far as principal repayments. So by combining these, you have bigger principal payments, which are more desirable and acceptable in the market and typically priced better.
Speaker A:
So another way of saying that is more people of these big agencies would rather buy a $3,750,000 bond than a 3,620,000, then to 1,650,000. Yeah. Because to them, that's not very much money, but to us it is. Okay, anybody else? Let's have a roll call.
Speaker B:
Councilmember Wagner?
Speaker D:
Yes.
Speaker B:
Councilmember Parisian?
Speaker C:
Yes.
Speaker B:
Mayor Blahigan?
Speaker A:
Yes. So for anybody that might be a mayor in the future, that's a way to stall. And look at the. The next item on the agenda. Next item on the agenda is ten b. We're being asked to accept a local climate action grant from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Yeah.
Speaker G:
Thank you, Mister mayor. Council, you'll recall back earlier this spring, city council approved a submission to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, or MPCA, for what is referred to as a local climate action grant. I. These are types of funding, special revenue that periodically will occur, different types of stipulations depending on the program, depending on the funding source, where we have been able to be very opportunistic in this last year with the new addition of a sustainability coordinator. These are the types of things that we're able to spread out, certainly over. It takes a lot of staff to do these types of things, but taking a lead in this kind of effort has really been fruitful. As we can see, this specific application went towards while in concurrence, we are doing a facility study with the public works garage area. That facility has long lived its use, so we're in the somewhere on the horizon looking to do some replacement. But like I say, in tandem with that study, one of the questions that came up is geothermal a possibility up here, something that we've never explored up there, and it's a legit operation, actually do the study to go forward and understand if we're even eligible for something like that. So utilizing this opportunistic program provided by the NPCA, we have applied for and been selected in the award amount of $20,000. There is a match component of up to a couple thousand dollars that can include in kind or staff time, which will easily hit as a part of this process, but looking for your approval to ultimately accept so we can move forward and find a contractor, conduct this work and help us move this project forward. With all that, staff would be happy to respond to any questions, comments or.
Speaker A:
Concerns, council, anything, Mister mayor?
Speaker C:
I don't have any questions, but I would just like to recognize the staff, including Kayla, for the work that went into applying for this grant. And I also want to thank the council for continuously building in climate action as our priorities.
Speaker A:
Anything else? So, yeah, thank you, council member Parisian. But for the fact that we now have a sustainability director, we may not have had time to apply for this grant and receive $20,000 in local climate action grant funds. So if I was figuring out the cost of the sustainability director being added to the staff, I'd take $20,000 away from that cost. And there are many other things that she's done that we haven't had time to do in the past that I believe will more than pay for the cost of adding this type of a person to our staff. I mean, she's doing a wonderful job on this and many other things. And of course, the staff is very supportive of this. It looks like we're intending on constructing a new public works facility about 2026 and. Okay, maybe later, maybe 2026 and having this kind of heating for the building. Geothermal heating and cooling will cost extra money, but it probably has a very, very quick payback. And so we will be saving as long as that building exists. Money on heating and cooling because of going geothermal, I would suspect. I. And in addition to that, we're doing the right thing, making the earth more a better place and destroying all life on earth at a slower rate. And hopefully, it's my hope that we don't destroy all life on earth and that we actually get to a carbon neutral situation, and this is one way to do it. So thank you for that. Any more editorials or comments? Okay, all those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye.
Speaker C:
I don't know that there's been a motion, motion yet. I'd be happy to make that motion. So I move that we authorize the city manager to sign the grant agreement with the Minnesota pollution Control Agency accepting $20,000 in local climate action grant funds.
Speaker D:
Second.
Speaker A:
All those in favor say aye.
Speaker C:
Aye.
Speaker D:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. Elizabeth, say no or nayez. Thank you for pointing that out, councilmember parisian. Next we get to item ten c or ten b, I suppose. Now fuel agreement with the city of Crystal, Minnesota. Yeah.
Speaker G:
Thank you, mister mayor. Council. So this is, again something that we started a conversation this last spring. I think a lot of these projects weren't just happenstance, they happen in tandem. Long term goal. We would love to incorporate fueling in our own, in our own area up at the public work site, but that's currently not happening. We do purchasing from a local entity, and in diving into it a bit more, staff has discovered that purchasing with the city of Crystal could incur a cost savings currently projected at just under $40,000. There are some startup costs gaining access key fobs, those types of things. But in looking at just based on bulk rate savings, roughly seventy one cents per gallon for unleaded fuel and gallon, excuse me, for diesel fuel. Of course. Diesel may have a variety of blends depending on the season, but those are projections that we put together based on our usage and what rates have been in recent history. The city of Crystal is able to benefit from, from purchasing fuel from the state contract so much like we do with a lot of our equipment. It's a set price, it's a base price, there's no fluctuation. We have a benefit of that with a number of other things that council is certainly familiar with, but currently we can't do that because we're not able to house that. So one of the, I want to call. One of the pieces of direction council gave in the springtime was to work with the current entity that we purchased from, unfortunately, just couldn't get to a point where it worked. And then with some staff turnover, it's taken us a bit longer to get to this point, maybe, than we had hoped. But we are currently, the language of the contract is with the attorneys, so we're expected to get that back here in the next day or two. But terms have come to an agreement between the two city managers. So ultimately, we're looking for authorization for the mayor and city manager to execute that final fuel facilities agreement with the city of Crystal. But before you get there, staff would be happy to respond. Any questions, comments, or concerns.
Speaker A:
So the name escapes me. We are entitled, and Crystal is entitled to get a state of Minnesota price on fuel. Is that true? Would they buy it through the Minnesota, what's it called?
Speaker G:
Yeah, mister mayor, we often refer to it as the state contract. There are a few different mechanisms for housing this. Sometimes when we talk about rolling stock, a certain number of vehicles are allotted to the state contract. So your local Ford dealership or Chevy dealership mail out, you know, 150 of these or 200 of those, and depending on timing, they open up once or twice a year. So cities that take advantage of the state contract, it's a base number, so you don't go in and you're not negotiating like you or I might. When we go and purchase a vehicle, it's a guaranteed rate that limits our need for any type of negotiation or getting multiple bids because it's set at that low point. This is similar in a more ongoing fashion. Rolling stock is maybe done once, twice, maybe three times a year, depending on availability, something like fuels on a more ongoing rolling basis. But again, in that same principle, guarantees that low rate.
Speaker A:
And so we could have one of these fueling stations at our public works if we wanted to, just like Crystal and Golden Valley does. But we are choosing not to do that at this time because we've got a whole new public works facility coming in 2026 or 2027 or whatever, and at that time, we probably will do our own fueling station. Meanwhile, we're spending five thousand dollars to seven thousand dollars in startup costs at Crystal, which will, according to the report, be paid back by the savings very quickly, and then we will continue as long as we have this contract with Crystal to save a lot of money on our fueling of our vehicles. And it could amount to. You're just guessing that there's a projected annual savings of $37,480.
Speaker G:
Yeah, Mister mayor council, the projection I can share a bit more on, it's based on fuel consumption in the last, we did a little more than a year. Year. And then based on prices over the last year. So looking forward, you know, we think about the last year, some of the bigger trucks, we didn't drive as much with less snow, but, you know, we had other vehicles that we're reusing more of. So these things do fluctuate. It is admittedly a best guess, but along with that comes that cost savings as the fuel prices more so fluctuate. For folks like you and I were able to maintain that consistent savings, so that cents per gallon, that would be consistent. The total cost is a projection based on the last more than a year.
Speaker A:
And then the last thing I would ask for, the convenience of future councils. It says here in the report, it should be noted the city intends to continue to purchase limited fuel locally for small fleet due to convenience. And I understand what that means, but I would ask that you report to the council in the future. Like how much was this? So if the council gets to seeing that this limited purchase for convenience is getting to be 32% of all the purchases, then the council will go, wait a minute, isn't there something we can do about that? So could you just tell the future council, like, this is what our experience was last year, once a year in a report, so that they can be your check and balance.
Speaker G:
Mister mayor. Council, I'd suggest. I think this is a great idea. I would suggest we wait until after the snow season. In part. A lot of our small equipment is for snow removal. We do have some mowers that we would use that for, but thinking of like the sidetrack and you see those kind of rolling machines that can blow snow with a driver inside of them. Those are the types of machines we're talking about. Okay, I think that's a great idea and recommend we do it next spring.
Speaker A:
All right, thank you, rest of the city council. Anything, Aaron?
Speaker D:
Yeah, just, thanks, mayor. Thanks for being creative and finding different cost saving mechanisms and being frugal and prudent with the city's money. So thank you to all the staff that worked on this, and thanks to the city of Crystal too, that are working with us to do this as well.
Speaker A:
So was there a motion?
Speaker D:
Sure, I'll move that. We authorize the mayor and the city manager to execute a fuel facilities agreement with the city of Crystal, Minnesota.
Speaker A:
Second, more discussion. All those in favor say aye. All those opposed? All those in favor say aye.
Speaker D:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. All those opposed say no. That motion carries. Okay. Eleven other business there were the voucher requests and we have the updated voucher request list here at the desk. Is there a question or a motion to approve disbursements for the period ending today?
Speaker C:
I move that we approve the disbursement requests for the period ending August 5, 2024 2nd.
Speaker A:
All those in favor say aye.
Speaker C:
Aye.
Speaker D:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. All those opposed say no or nay. That motion carries. Next, we have other business item b.
Speaker B:
Yes. Thank you, mayor. Members of the council, as you know, we're currently in an election right now, and after each local election, there needs to be a canvassing board that meets in order to declare the results of those local elections. Our city council serves as the canvassing board for city elections. And per state statute, the council must meet or the board must meet on either the second or third day after the primary election to review and canvas to review the canvas, report and declare the results. I would note that meeting is open to the public for people to attend. So staff is recommending because of the timeline that the meeting be held on Friday, August 16, which is the third day after the election. It's on the third day recommended instead of the second, just to give more time for results to be tabulated and the county to give us the results back to. There's no language currently in statute that says it has to be in an. An evening meeting, so that time could be altered. In the past, they've been at 05:00 p.m. but it's not equitable always for everyone to be in night. So it could be during the day if the council wants to also. So staff is recommending the day, but is looking to council to set a time for that.
Speaker A:
So one thing that occurred to me is this is a Friday in the summer. Okay, you know where I'm going. All right, so up north. So what do you two want to do? Or do you even want to have it on this day? Do you want to have it on the 15th, or do you want to have it earlier in the day?
Speaker D:
Well, it sounds like staff would prefer to have it Friday. I mean, I could do it Friday, just the latest. I would ask that we do it at 06:00 p.m. but would you be.
Speaker A:
Open to 03:30 p.m. or something?
Speaker D:
Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah, I could do it literally, I think, almost any time, except for, like.
Speaker A:
10:00 a.m. what about you, Mia?
Speaker C:
Yeah, I can. I can make any time work, including during the day.
Speaker A:
Would you prefer it earlier so that you would have the flexibility to go?
Speaker I:
Sure.
Speaker G:
Okay, sounds great.
Speaker D:
What time would noon work, I mean, I don't know.
Speaker A:
Works for me.
Speaker G:
Go ahead, mister mayor council. You can go as early as 08:00 a.m. if you like.
Speaker D:
I wouldn't. Well, yeah, I would prefer to do it, you know, after 11:00 a.m. so noon, I think, would be my preference.
Speaker A:
Okay, so noon. Okay. So is there a motion to schedule the preliminary election canvas board meeting on Friday, August 16 at high noon?
Speaker C:
So moved.
Speaker D:
Second.
Speaker A:
You can tell I've watched a lot of westerns. Okay. All those in favor say aye. Aye. All those opposed say no or nay. That motion carries. All right, next thing on the agenda would normally be to ask for administrative reports. Are there administrative reports?
Speaker D:
Mister Mayor, I believe you had an item c you added to other business.
Speaker A:
Yeah, I'm missing a page here of my. Yeah, I'm missing a page.
Speaker D:
What was it for? Sipes.
Speaker G:
Mister mayor council, there was a proposal to consider a proclamation or some sort of.
Speaker A:
Yeah, okay. I was the one that put it there. All right, so sipe is. It's called Sipes car care. Now. Sipes car care has been in business for a hundred years this year, I don't know, but I think it was probably started by Walt Sipe, who was the best friend of my grandfather, William Kavanaugh, who the Kavanaugh school was named after. And then Tom Sipe is his and son, and Tom Sipe is in his eighties now, and he's still running the service station. So between he and his father, there have been 100 years of sipes being in Robinsdale as a service station, gas station, etcetera. I think the original station was probably right where pawn America is right now. And my grandfather used to have exciting entertainment there on Sunday afternoons when he would go walk over to Walt Sipes gas station that wasn't open, and they would play checkers or cribbage. And it was kind of a real wild time for them on Sunday afternoon. And anyway, it's been a car centers have been like a center for public input and things around town, more so in the old days. But then both Walt Seipp and Tom Seipp have also been fire chiefs in the city of Robinsdale. I think Walt Seif was the fire chief. You could look in the pictures in the wall in the fire station right now. So this business has done a lot of service to the city of Robinsdale. Councilmember Murphy decided that maybe we should have a declaration that a certain day, probably the day of their celebration, that it's coming up, be declared Sipes Day. In the city of Robbinsdale. I suppose you should name it Sipes Day. Whatever the name of the business is in the city of Robinsdale. So I'm asking my colleagues. You think that's a good idea?
Speaker C:
Yeah, I think that sounds great.
Speaker A:
Okay, so go ahead, mister mayor.
Speaker G:
Council. Just so I can bring it back together. Greg seit, the next in the generations. He put in an application. You'll recall last July that you approved for an event this Saturday. And if I'm hearing correctly, counsel's giving staff direction to create an issue, a proclamation dedicating the day as such as the business's official day. We can craft some language and put some things together, and we'd be happy to promote it. If I'm hearing correctly, that's the direction council's giving staff at this point?
Speaker D:
I think so.
Speaker A:
True. Okay. Yeah. And I'm not worried about the precedent. Any business that stays in business here in Robbinsdale for 100 years and doesn't move out of town, I think we should do the same for them. All right. That doesn't need a motion. We're just giving you direction. Is that what you're looking for? Okay, so what else have we got on my agenda? That's really not my agenda. Administrative reports. Okay, so, administrators, do you have reports?
Speaker B:
Yes. Thank you, mayor and members of the council. I'd just like to let people know, if they don't already, that we're currently in an election for the state primary. The actual election day is on August 13, which is a Tuesday, where you can vote at your polling location on that day, which is ward specific. Otherwise, you can vote early at city hall. Right now, we're open from eight until 430. On Saturday. We're open additional time from 09:00 to 03:00 and then next Monday, we're open until 05:00 p.m. for early voting at city hall on the day, you'll vote at your polling location, like I already said. But I just encourage people to get out there and vote, especially with our local races on the ballots, too.
Speaker A:
Thank you.
Speaker D:
I have a question about that. If I order a absentee ballot and it arrives to me in the mail, can I come to city hall and drop it off?
Speaker B:
Yes, you can.
Speaker A:
Yep.
Speaker B:
You can do that until 08:00 p.m. on the day of the election.
Speaker D:
Perfect. Thank you.
Speaker A:
Okay. Anything but you.
Speaker G:
Mister mayor. Council, a few quick updates. I want to offer my thanks all to whom participated in the patent parade. Another fun event. We had a nice night for it. Want to share that the city is currently accepting letters of interest for the newly formed sustainability committee. Deadline is August 25. If you're looking for more information or curious a bit more about what the structure of that is, jump onto the city website. And we have that under the sustainability tab. Currently have registration open for fall and winter recreation activities. And along those lines, don't forget the twins are hosting a free, free youth baseball clinic this Friday from five to seven. Would encourage the public to join us. That's at the public safety open house this Saturday from eleven to three, up at the public safety building. And then want to remind folks to please join us for the LRT open house at Elam church. That's Wednesday, August 21. From six to eight. If you can't join us or that's not your particular cup of tea, please jump onto the city website. We've got a survey where we're collecting feedback from folks. The intention is to put all this together. We'll be given to council for their consideration as we creep up to municipal consent and then want to wish everybody a happy, happy national night out tomorrow night. And that's all I got.
Speaker A:
So national night out is a chance to get together with your neighbors. And usually it's out in the street, get to talking to them so you know each other, you can bond with each other and you, it's probably a thing that's going to promote safety in the neighborhood because you know your neighbors and you're more aware of what things are going on and what things are untoward that might be happening because you know your neighbors and you know, thus and such wouldn't be happening. And even if it doesn't promote public safety, it's kind of a great way to get the neighborhoods together. So look for national night out parties in your neighborhood and attend them and bond with people. So, Aaron, and you're next.
Speaker D:
Thank you, mayor. Yeah, I just want to thank everybody that came to city hall today and spoke or was just present. It's great to see that much engagement from the community. I've said this before. I kind of wish I, you know, more issues got that level of engagement, but I'll take what I can get. So I just appreciate everybody that showed up. I also just want to, yeah, I guess encourage people to go, to go vote by the either before on the 13th. And then I think this is our last meeting before because we should be seating the new council member at the next council meeting. So I'm looking forward to that as well. And I, yeah, just, I guess that's all my thoughts. So I'll hand it off.
Speaker A:
Okay. Other than what you two have said in my talk about national night out, I don't. I'm sorry. You know, are you the one that I do this to the most?
Speaker G:
No.
Speaker A:
I kind of think.
Speaker C:
But to be honest, I have all the same things to share, so I will. I'll be brief. But aside from reminding folks to go vote, I would love to thank all the election judges and staff for all the work that you've put into this unique election season for us here in Robbinsdale. I hope everyone has a fun and safe national night out tomorrow. And I would also like to thank folks for coming in and sharing their viewpoints before the meeting today. And again, I share all the same sentiments. So that's all from me.
Speaker A:
Okay. Very good. You know, maybe the best way to do this is just to not worry about who was first on the agenda and just go the same way every time. Or start somewhere. Anyway, I apologize for that. I have nothing more to add besides what Mia and Aaron said and the fact that we have national night out. So is there a motion to adjourn?
Speaker C:
I move we adjourn.
Speaker D:
Second.
Speaker A:
All those in favor say aye.
Speaker C:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. All those opposed say no, or that motion carries. We're adjourned.
