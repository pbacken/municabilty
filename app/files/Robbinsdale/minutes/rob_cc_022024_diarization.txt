Speaker A:
Agenda is going to be. Are there members of the staff or the city council that want to add to or alter what tonight's agenda is?
Speaker B:
Yes. Thank you, mayor. I will be adding two items to tonight's agenda. The first one is for new business item b. This was to consider invest city investment strategies, and we're just adding a resolution to that item. And then the next one is going to be adding the voucher report for the other business item. A. Council received that report via email earlier today, and there's also a printed version if anyone wants to view it here tonight. And those would be the two items that I'm adding to the agenda for this.
Speaker A:
With regard to new business item b, actual resolution that was referred to in our materials, do the other two members of the council have a copy of that resolution in their packets there?
Speaker B:
They don't have a copy of it printed out, which I could certainly do quickly, but they did receive it via email earlier today.
Speaker A:
Okay, and you're nodding that you looked at that. I just didn't, apparently look at that. Okay, so any member of the council have anything they wish to add or change with regard to the agenda hearing? None. Is there a motion to approve what tonight's agenda is?
Speaker C:
And Miss mayor, I move that we approve tonight's agenda with the additions mentioned by staff.
Speaker A:
Second, all those in favor of approving the agenda, as clarified by the city clerk, signified by saying aye.
Speaker C:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. All those opposed say no. That motion carries. Okay, next, we have the consent agenda pursuant to council rules. One motion, non debatable, will approve the recommendation. Noted. Any member of the city council may ask for an item to be taken from the consent agenda for discussion. Separate action. Such items removed from the consent agenda shall be considered immediately following approval of the balance of the consent agenda. Does anyone have anything that they wish to pull from the consent agenda?
Speaker D:
Mister Mayor hearing? None. I would like to make a motion to approve the consent agenda.
Speaker A:
Second, all those in favor of approving the consent agenda, items a through f signify by saying aye.
Speaker D:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. All those opposed say no or nay. That motion carries. So what did we approve? We approved some minutes, minutes from the special work session of February 12, 2024. That was a city council work session. And from the work session of February 13, 2024, we authorized the city manager to execute a labor agreement. We approved a violent crime reduction task force. We approved certain licenses as listed in our materials, and we authorize staff to apply for a national park service, rivers, trails and conservation assistance program. Next we have presentations, and tonight there are no presentations. So we go to public hearings tonight. There are no public hearings. Old business. There is no old business scheduled. We go to ten a page 22 of our materials accepting seed grant funds from the University of Minnesota. And I think our city manager will be talking about that.
Speaker E:
Yeah. Thank you, Mister mayor. Council, in part because we've got a lighter agenda here tonight that we'd pull this one off just to discuss. I know council has been interested with some of the sustainability related efforts we've been trying to make, specifically through special revenue, or we sometimes call grant funding. This is something that our Greencore member, NOAA Cap, this year's Greencor member, and the sustainability coordinator, Kayla Kurtz, applied for through the clean energy resource team, or CERT. This goes back to the end of 2023. And we were just notified here in the last couple of weeks that we were selected to receive the $5,000. We're in the process, as noted, just having received this a couple of weeks ago, identifying exactly the mechanism. But the dollars will be allocated towards people having a home energy audit. This goes back to some of the work done through the partners in energy and the plans that have been either within or created in tandem to those sustainability related efforts can be anything from big operations within the city day to day, but also the residential component that we can help influence or we can help promote. And this was an opportunity to do. As such, we had a little bit of a write up here. Ultimately, we're looking for by motion the council to approve acceptance of the $5,000, which I assume you will. But before we get there, if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, I'd be happy to respond.
Speaker A:
So it says in the staff report that our staff members are going to help Robbinsdale citizens. At least 50 energy burdened Robbinsdale residents, or maybe households, I guess, get free or reduced cost heis energy audits. Home energy squad is heis, and they will be probably targeting the installation of energy efficient materials in the various households that they audit. I would think that this would help these people that take these audits, save money and help the earth, too, in that we would be saving natural resources over a period of time.
Speaker E:
Mister Mayor, I think you hint at a good point. One thing we find with a lot of residential, maybe single family homes, even otherwise, it can seem to be a hurdle or a burden just to get that first step in. But to have somebody come in professionally identify those leaking windows, that weather stripping, certainly, you know, the tens of thousands of dollars that people may invest into solar, that might be two or three projects down the road. But really, this is to encourage people to take a look, have a professional do so. Some things are very simple, and you see a cost savings immediately. So I think what you're hinting at is, absolutely, that's true. It's to go in and find some cost savings right away and maybe build up a little list for near future and then further down the road.
Speaker A:
Yeah. I try to be cognizant in my house of ways to make that envelope tighter to save energy. And I'm sure if one of these energy auditors came to my house, she or he would find many things that, hey, you could do this better. You could do that better. So I'd encourage everybody to do that, sort of in connect, and I'll hear from other city council members when they want here. But in connection with that, I know Noah Knapp, our person that we get from green steps. I think he's talking to restaurants, and I would be willing to go with him. I don't need to, but if he thinks it would help for me to go with when he goes to these restaurants and say, hey, the mayor is here, and these, we're just seeking your input, and we would like you to try to become as energy conscious as you can. I know a couple restaurants in town are really making an effort to do some great work with regard to their materials and what they do. But if he wants me to come with him to kind of introduce him and get the program, I don't know, maybe it gets it more elevated in their minds as to the seriousness of the thing. I would be willing to do that. So I want that to be known. So other members of the city council, any comment about this or motion?
Speaker D:
Yeah, I would just like to extend thanks to both Kayla and Noah for their efforts in applying for this grant. I know that that takes time and resources and effort, so congrats on receiving the funds, and we appreciate your work in order to make that happen. Additionally, it's really nice to see how these efforts are really in line with some of the goals that we talked about as a council a couple weeks ago in our work session. One of our priorities really being around sustainability and also all of the effort that has been put into partners in energy as well. I know that is another avenue in which the council has formulated a lot of goals for the next several years, and it's nice to see a lot of these efforts kind of connecting to each other. So well done. Kayla and Noah.
Speaker A:
Thanks.
Speaker C:
Paul. Home energy squad. Who are they affiliated with? Do you have a little background on that organization?
Speaker E:
Yeah. Thank you, mister mayor. Council. Council member Murphy. Home Energy squad is in partnership with C E, the name. Why is it escaping me? At the moment? The same group that we're looking to do some loan rehab projects with continuing to 2024 through the EDA program.
Speaker C:
So safe say, is it roughly $100 per household that it would cost that were there get to 50 residents?
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker E:
Mister mayor, council. Council member Murphy. The goal was originally in the $50 to $100 range. Currently, part of the process we're looking to identify is can we figure out a bit of economy of scale. So if we can schedule an entire day to be over in Robbinsdale and get a few more, a bit bigger bang for our bucks, so to speak, I think at minimum would be 50. And if we can stretch that dollar, we'll look to do that.
Speaker C:
Got it. Thank you.
Speaker A:
Does anybody have a motion?
Speaker D:
Mister mayor, I move that we authorize the city manager to sign the contract with the University of Minnesota accepting the $5,000 in seed grant dollars.
Speaker A:
Second discussion. I want to thank the University of Minnesota for offering such a program, a seed grant program. All those in favor signify by saying aye.
Speaker D:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. All those opposed say no. That motion carries. Okay, the next item on the agenda is new business item B. Yeah.
Speaker E:
Thank you, Mister mayor. Council. So this is something council's familiar with, but to give a bit of an introduction for the public going back, and I'll give a high synopsis, certainly would like to allow the mayor to give his input as he was integral into the process. But prior to the start of 2024, cities like Robinsdale were not allowed to do certain types of investment, in some parts having to do with population and some having to do with credit rating. Here in Robbinsdale, due to the size of our city, it's incredibly difficult to get to a aaa, aa, and AA is seen as pretty darn good in certainly my opinion, professional opinions of others. But that didn't allow us to invest in the manner that we're now allowed to. The updated legislation, which I know the mayor can speak to. That process having gone through the legislature in 2023, approved for January 1 of 2024 now through Minnesota Statute 118 a zero nine, which is a part of which is, I should say in your packet, does allow for cities like Robbinsdale to invest through. Staff has formally presented this to council at the work session last weekend or last week. Excuse me. What we are recommending is to go through the Minnesota SBI, state Board of Investments, essentially through an S and P index fund that allows, again, cities to invest in the manner as described. We have attached, as was discussed earlier, a resolution to that effect signifying what that would look like, including the process going forward, some items that were outlined as a part of the discussion last week, and ultimately looking for your approval for that resolution so we can start this program again. Wanting to give the mayor some space so he can talk about the process both in. I would share my appreciation for where he participated, but also where this allows us to maybe play a little catch up with some of those larger cities where it wasn't an opportunity prior. After that, staff would be happy to respond to questions, comments or concerns.
Speaker A:
This has taken a few years to do this, so I apologize to the city council, who's now probably hearing it for the fifth or 10th time. This is really for the public. I noticed a couple years ago that AAA cities were AAA plus. Golden Valley was a aa at the time. I don't know what they are now. And so AAA cities bond rating and cities over 100,000 could invest in certain ways that we AAA plus could not invest. So we went to the legislature through Mike Freiberg, our representative in the House, and Ann Rest, our senator. And it didn't go through the first year in 2022. In the 2023 legislative session, they brought it back and rest had additional responsibilities as more of a Senate leader. So Bonnie Westland of Plymouth, senator, she was the chief sponsor in the Senate and Mike Freiberg was the chief sponsor in the House. So I would like to thank them. I'd like to thank the League of Minnesota Cities that helped figure out how to word this and where to go, what committees, and to make sure that it tracked. It passed last year. It was effective immediately when it passed, which, I don't know, it might have been April of last year. It allows us to invest in, in particular, what we're going to do is go through the state board of investment, and our particular investments will be handled by PERA, the Public Employees Retirement association. But that's part of the state board of investment really, where the money is. They have billions of dollars under management, and we get to put up to 15% of certain types of our reserves, which might be as much as $7 million into what this is, is an indexed fund that goes along with, I believe it's standard and Poor's. It's the 500, or maybe it's Dow Jones 500, I don't remember. Anyway, had we done that for the last five years, every million dollars that we had in here would have garnered. Even though there was a year that went down 10.9%, there was a year that went up 40 point x percent. Every million dollars that we, Robinsdale had would have garnered another $787,000 in earnings benefits. So this could be used to help the taxpayers. I would like to put the entire $7 million if we could. We can't because we have cash flow situations in this account. This particular resolution that we're passing tonight is a bit more conservative and there's nothing wrong with that. And we are authorizing at, in the now, therefore, clause at number one a, the staff to invest not 15% of certain types of reserves, not all of our reserves, certain types of reserves. We're authorizing 5%, up to 5% of the funds to be invested in this way, sort of as a trial to see if we can make more money. I have no doubt that over a period of time, I hope this year turns out well because it's not going to look good if the first year is down. But I have no doubt over a period of time that we'll earn hundreds of thousands of extra dollars this way. And so I'm excited that we're going to be starting this ASAP. I would not expect the entire 5% that you're authorizing to happen immediately because again, there's, we've got the money put into different other things. During the five years that I was talking about, 13 point some percent on average compounded yearly would have been made had we been able to do this. And instead we were investing in t notes and treasury bonds and other things that are like super safe, which is good, but we were earning 1.5 to 2.5%. So this will again, hopefully get us extra money at the end of every year. And at the end of this year I am going to say, hey, if we would have invested the whole amount, this is how much we would have had. And I really hope that we don't come to a situation where we say, yeah, it's a good thing we didn't do that, Bill, because the markets went down this year. So, but over again, over a period of time, I think this will work out. So that was kind of a long explanation for that. Anybody else have anything?
Speaker C:
No questions. Well done. This is a great opportunity for Robinson. So nice job.
Speaker A:
I hope it works. It will over a period of time, but I hope it works immediately.
Speaker D:
Wholeheartedly. Agree?
Speaker E:
Yes.
Speaker D:
Well done. Thank you for bringing this to staff and council.
Speaker A:
So does anybody have a motion?
Speaker C:
Mister mayor, I would move that we approve the resolution that would implement the additional long term equity investment authority pursuant to the Minnesota statute, section one one eight a zero nine second.
Speaker A:
Anybody have any discussion? All those in favor say aye.
Speaker E:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. All those opposed say no or nay. That motion carries. Okay. Thank you so much. Let's see how it works. And I might add, we asked the staff to tell us quarterly how this is going and you give us quarterly reports on our investments anyway, so that's going to be an added thing. All right, next on the agenda is voucher requests. We have those at the table. We have them in our email. It's to pay the bills that we have. Is there a question, comment or a motion in regard to other business? Eleven. A voucher requests.
Speaker D:
I will move that we approve the disbursement requests for the period ending February 20 2nd.
Speaker A:
All those in favor say aye.
Speaker E:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. All those opposed say no or nay. A motion carries. Next. We have administrative reports. Do we have administrators reporting?
Speaker B:
Thank you, mayor. Members of the council, I'm just going to keep plugging in our elections that are happening right now. I think it's an important reminder for people that are watching and listening, but we are currently in an election for a presidential nomination primary. The actual election day is on March 5, but you can come to city hall early and vote from 08:00 a.m. to 04:30 p.m. and there's also some extended times for people that want to vote and they can go to our city website to see those times. We're also going to be hosting award two special election in May. So if anyone wants to file for candidacy, that will also open on March 5 and go through March 19. Again, more information can be found on our website or by calling the city. And that's the only update I have for tonight. So thank you.
Speaker A:
Thank you. Anything from the city manager staff?
Speaker E:
Thank you, mister mayor. Council, I'll be brief. A few quick updates. First, want to share my thanks to certainly city staff leadership and city council. Last week I thought what we had was a fantastic goal setting session, a continuation of last year's discussion, but sort of some checking in and how things are going, what's working, what's not working and where do we want to go for the next year forward. So I thought a thorough but very good conversation. I know council put the work in last week between the goal setting and EDA and work session certainly put your time in. So a lighter agenda tonight I think is good for everybody. Note a few things for the city here. Cities continues to accept applications for an engineering technician and a police records clerk. Want to share things? We've got some good feedback in city hall as the city continues to recognize black History Month in February. We're now two thirds of the way through the city through a couple different mechanisms, the Bird town brief that weekly e news and social media have been posting. It's not just events and spaces that we're doing here in the city, but in the neighborhood where people can get involved. I would also note the segueing from the Bertown brief. For those who don't subscribe, we have a fire captain, Darren Olson, who was highlighted. If you haven't yet, check out that story. I think. Very cool. And then the last thing is my laptop is being finicky here. The Robbinsdale Crime Prevention Association, RCPA works does a lot of events throughout the year with RPD currently looking to recruit some new volunteers and looking for a bit direction. Some of that will continue directly with RPD sometime on their own, sometimes with the Mac. The group that I know councilmember Parisian will join me at here in a couple of weeks in March. You can find more information, certainly on the city website, Tennessee's Facebook. That's all for me.
Speaker A:
Okay, council members, I've got Mia Parisian first.
Speaker D:
Thank you. I don't have much for tonight. I would just also like to extend thanks to staff and all the attendees for the goal session last week. I also want to give kudos on this last bird town brief. I think you mentioned a lot of the things that I just want to give kudos on around sharing events in our area around black history. Great info on garden plots becoming available, so maybe, Tim, you could briefly speak. If anyone is not subscribed to the Bird Town brief, what's the best way for them to get subscribed?
Speaker E:
Yeah. Thank you Mister mayor, council consul, Mayor Parisian. I would say hop onto the website. In the little search tab, just type in Bird town brief. It'll take you right there. Real quick and easy. Put your email in, sends you a confirmation email. You click on that and you're signed up.
Speaker D:
Perfect. Thank you for sharing that. Other than that, I want to thank the organizers of the bird bash coming up the first weekend in March. Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend, but based on last year's event, it was a real success and a great, great cause for our schools. So encourage people to attend if they can. Other than that, that's all from me.
Speaker A:
Thank you. Very informative. Thank you, Regan Murphy.
Speaker C:
Thank you Mister mayor. One quick item. I had some residents question some of our purple streetlights in Robbinsville. And I. I went and looked at them. They're very purple. There's some on Shoreline Drive. And I reached out to Richard McCoy because I then found an article. It was entitled why street lights are turning purple throughout the US. And there was a manufacturing defect. And some led lights, some were installed here. And it's. I don't know if you've seen it, but it is like literally purple. Richard's aware of it and they've ordered new light bulbs or parts for this. So for the residents that were interested in that, it will be fixed. So that's it. Thank you.
Speaker A:
Thank you. I'm kind of glad they're not like a green bay colors. Green and gold.
Speaker C:
Yeah. No good pie. I thought it was kind of, oh, maybe it's a prince thing or I. Maybe a viking guy, I don't know. But you're right.
Speaker A:
So I would like to highlight a few things that Mia highlighted and Regan too. Birdbash. This year, their theme is to give a little extra help to bands, orchestras and vocal in District 281. And for years they've been known as a great department in that regard. Even, you know, kind of statewide famous bird town brief. You indicated how. So people should just go on the back to the bird bash. People should go on the seven Dreams foundation spelled out, I believe, s e v e n. Dreams foundation website and look and see how they can contribute to that and or buy a ticket and come to the actual event, which is on March 1, Saturday and March, March 2. So that would be a good thing for you to do. Tim, you explained how to get Birdtown briefs. There are some public safety things, police notices that we can subscribe to by email, too. How do you do that? What are those, mister mayor?
Speaker E:
Council. So it would be the same way if you jump onto the city's website, there is a communications landing page. So anything from what we've discussed, the Burrtown brief, public safety notices, there's a tip 411 component, so that's sort of an outside piece, but there's a link to get you there. And then even the more standard practice items you can sign up to have, like council agendas, those types of things sent to you. Well, so there's a whole list of things. Jump onto our communications page for more information.
Speaker A:
Okay, thank you. I would like to give my condolences and I'm thinking maybe we should have a city council letter, may be signed by the city manager and whoever else you think too, expressing our condolences to the city of Burnsville and the police department and the public safety department about this incident where two police officers were murdered and a EMT firefighter was murdered this past weekend. These people are just out there doing their duty and, you know, they didn't know that they were just trying to protect the public, and they didn't know that they wouldn't be coming home after their shift. And another police officer was wounded severely enough to be put in the hospital. And hopefully, well, it looks like he's recovering, so maybe you could come up with something. And if the other council members want to sign that, too, you know, I think we could send that maybe to the actual city of Burnsville and to their police and fire departments. So I'm very sorry to hear about that. Better news is that the staff did do a very excellent job, I think, on our goals and objectives. Session. It wasn't really that long. I mean, over my many years, I've had times when we stayed overnight at a hotel and had a Friday night session and all day Saturday session and for how long this was, I think we got a lot accomplished. We piggybacked off of what we did last year. We had members of the staff, a lot of members of the staff, you know, the department heads and some others here. And I thought that they were very helpful, too. And so I was happy to see how well that went and how much we got done so quickly. And that is all I have. So a motion to adjourn would be in order.
Speaker C:
I would move we adjourn this evening.
Speaker A:
Second, all those in favor of adjourning say aye. Aye. All those opposed say no or nay. That motion carries. Thank you.
Speaker E:
It.
