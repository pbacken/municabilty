Speaker A:
Tonight's agenda is, does staff have anything that they wish to change with regard to what the agenda is tonight?
Speaker B:
Thanks, mayor and council members. I have just one addition I'd like to make to the agenda for tonight. Council received this in an email earlier, and also it's printed out tonight, but it's the voucher disbursement report, the actual report for other business item a. So if you want to take a peek at it, you can. Otherwise, council did see it earlier, so that's the only addition I have.
Speaker A:
And we already have a printout of what it was before you updated it. Yes. Right. Okay. Any other staff members, any council members suggestions about what the agenda is? Is there a motion to approve the what the agenda is tonight?
Speaker C:
I move we approve tonight's agenda.
Speaker A:
Second, all those in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Okay. We move to the consent agenda pursuant to council policy. One motion, non debatable, will approve the recommendation. Noted. Any member of the city council may withdraw for second, for separate action, an item from the consent agenda. Such items removed from the consent agenda shall be considered immediately after approval of the balance of the consent agenda. Does anyone have anything they wish to withdraw from the consent agenda hearing?
Speaker C:
None. I move that we approve tonight's consent agenda.
Speaker A:
Items a through g. Second, non debatable item. All those in favor signify by saying aye.
Speaker D:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. All those opposed say nay or no. That item carries. So what did we approve on the consent agenda? We approved the certain city council meeting minutes, February 6, 2024. A memorandum of understanding with regard to the farmers market. We approved credit card charges as indicated. And at our desks, we authorized the city manager to execute an organized labor agreement for the captains. I believe we approved a mobile food unit in Robins center. We approved a grant at the acceptance of a $6,000 grant for no child left inside. And we approved certain licenses. And with that, we move to presentations. We have a presentation tonight with regard to the Hennepin County District Court, and Chief Judge Kerry Meyer is here to address us on that item. Thank you for coming to the city of Robbinsdale to talk to us about this.
Speaker E:
Thank you so much for having me. My name is Kerry Meyer. I'm the chief judge of the Hennepin County District Court, which, of course, includes your city. And so I'm trying to make the rounds and just make sure we have open communication and that any questions you have about the district court are answered. We have a short, I hope you have a short version, the four minute video, so that you don't have to, you know, have death by PowerPoint of me presenting all of this.
Speaker B:
So I think I can, I will play that for you right now.
Speaker E:
Thank you.
Speaker F:
The fourth judicial District of Minnesota is the largest of the ten districts in the Minnesota judicial branch. The fourth serves nearly 1.3 million residents within the 45 cities that make up Hennepin county. The fourth judicial district serves the community from six facilities, including locations in Brooklyn Center, Minnetonka and Minneapolis. We take pride in providing quality service to our community. Our commitment to service includes many firsts and innovations. The first african american chief district judge in Minnesota first livestream of a trial in the state. Developed e file and serve paperless filing system used throughout the branch self help centers, which have become the norm throughout the state. A focus on treatment courts for drug addiction, mental health and veterans. A race equity initiative launched in 2017, providing text and email reminders of court appearances, which are now standard across the state. Created a youth justice council in juvenile court, providing a warrant helpline that reduces failure to appear and helps clear warrants without incarceration. The mission of the fourth judicial district is to provide justice through a system that assures equal access for the fair and timely resolution of cases and controversy.
Speaker G:
The fourth judicial district consists of five court civil, criminal, family, juvenile and probate. Mental health services are provided at six Hennepin County Government Center, Family Justice Center, Juvenile Justice center, the public safety facility and the Brookdale and Ridgedale courthouses. In 2023, the fourth handled over 405,000 filings. That is 37% of the state's legal filings. Our district has 63 judges. That number is set by the state legislature. In addition, we have 13 referees. Referees are licensed attorneys and in Hennepin county we use our referees like judges. We also have over 560 employees across our entire district. These are the people that support our 1.3 million residents.
Speaker F:
There are several priorities the fourth is focusing on for 2024. These priorities address the challenges facing our court system and impacting our community. To continue providing services in an efficient manner, we must address increased filings in housing court with a 76% increase since 2019. The court's most serious felony filings are consistently increasing each year. Over 20,000 interpreter requests in 2023 for 83 languages increased need for services for defendants experiencing addiction and mental health issues increased need for more public defenders to reduce number of self represented litigants and defendants over 75% of family court litigants are self represented. Increased need for more caseworkers for the child in need of protection services program the fourth judicial district is grateful to the people in our community who give of their time and talents to make the legal system flow efficiently from citizens serving as jurors to county and city administrators working with our teams, Hennepin County's residents are served well by the contributions of many. Together, we work toward a better future and equal justice for all.
Speaker E:
Thank you for playing that. I also want to thank you for coming to see. We had an open house in January, and he spent some time with us, I think the afternoon with us, just learning a little bit about what's happening in our courts. As you hopefully know, the courts do not keep any of the fines or surcharges for cases that are prosecuted, but we do return to the jurisdiction a percentage of the fines and surcharges as set by statute. And in 2023, the district court disbursed just under $169,000 to the city of Robinsdale. So there's, you know, the work that's being done in the court. Some of that does come back to you. So I'm happy to answer any questions.
Speaker G:
I don't know what's on your minds.
Speaker E:
Here in Robinsdale, if there's anything specific you have questions about or not.
Speaker A:
Council members, do you have questions?
Speaker H:
Thanks for coming.
Speaker A:
So I would just say, you probably wouldn't say this yourself, but the chief judge gets elected by the other judges, so 63, a majority of 63 people probably thought you'd do a pretty good job. So thank you for doing that. And it's sort of like we have 76 judges, as Judge Meyer pointed out. We have, or the video, we have twelve referees and 63 judges. That's sort of like 76 judges, and there's two probate court registrars and maybe some other. And there's. They're not really, like, adjudicating things, but they're sort of taking away the burden from the judiciary. In the statistics here, it says that 22% of Minnesotans live in the fourth judicial district, Hennepin county. It also says that you handle 37% of the cases. So people like me that have practiced law feel comfortable. We have a choice of jurisdictions often, and we feel comfortable in Hennepin county when we can, you know, we might go to one jurisdiction or the other. Also, a high percentage of the business and commerce is in Hennepin county. So that makes it so that there's a disproportionate number compared to our population of cases that are in Hennepin county. I'm not an expert on this, but it seems to me, just from my experience since 1979, being licensed to practice that Hennepin county is for sure, in the five state area, the most sophisticated county of all the counties. They've laid out in their presentation here, some of the things that Hennepin county has been a leader in establishing, like the, the e filing system. And I know that drug court was kind of a thing that a prior judge, Kevin Burke, kind of helped establish, and champion, and Hennepin county is just a leader in everything. I also point out that according to the statistics, 87.2% of the cases are criminal cases. So people often wonder, why, why aren't we getting faster determination of our cases here in this judicial system? But you've got to have a speedy trial under the Constitution if you're involved in a criminal matter. So the fact that 87.2% of the cases are criminal matters and the fact that you've got to have a speedy trial makes it, when there's limited resources, kind of, you get delayed on your other trials, and that's a thing that they have to jump through and try to negotiate. So, you know, all in all, that wasn't any questions. That was more observations that I've made. But all in all, and, oh, and I've been around in times when there's been republican governors and democratic governors, and Jesse Ventura, an independent governor. And with very few exceptions, I have thought that the judiciary, not only in Hennepin county, but in the state of Minnesota, has been very fair. And I hardly ever would go and be there, like, thinking, oh, this person's a Democrat or Republican. It's almost always by the law, by the evidence. And so, yeah, I think the system that we have is as good as we can get it, and there's obviously room for improvement. But you're done. You've done a great job. So thank you.
Speaker E:
Well, I appreciate that. It's not why I came, but I appreciate that you clearly understand what's happening and had it been and appreciate it, your time tonight.
Speaker A:
All right, very good.
Speaker E:
Thank you.
Speaker A:
Thank you. All right, so the next thing on the agenda is public hearings, and we have none of those. Then we go to old business. We are being asked to authorize the city manager to execute a license agreement with birdhouse restaurant.
Speaker D:
Yeah. Thank you, mister mayor. Council. So this is a continuation of an agreement. We typically only do this for x amount of months. Due to the nice weather we've been having these past several weeks. The birdhouse is eager to set up their exterior patio. For those not familiar maybe watching on tv, the patio is actually a parcel owned by the city, considered a city park, but again, in the last several years is a section of not the entirety, but a section of it has been leased out to the adjacent restaurant there. I would note that in 2023, staff worked with council to do some updating of the terms, in large part due to going back into the 2020 2021. There were some rules and caveats being followed, more strict to Covid, and again, whether that's by the city, county or state agency, but getting that really dialed in in 2023, we did update the policy for use of the plaza. I would note some of the specifics as noted in your memo here, allowing for the space by the Lions club during Whizbang days, certainly a popular event, the payable fee would continue. We would make sure that that stays consistent. Final review. We would still have to go up there after the patio itself is set up with the building official and fire marshal to ensure code safety and any considered relations to SAC and WAC. All operations meet requirements of any associated licensure, and that includes liquor licensing, probably the most stringent, and then continued observations of limitations, requirements, identification and termination clauses. So staff would certainly be happy to respond to questions, comments or concerns. But again, what we're looking for is by motion authorization for the city manager to execute a license agreement with the birdhouse restaurant.
Speaker A:
Questions? Comments?
Speaker D:
Seems like a good idea to me.
Speaker C:
No happy support.
Speaker D:
I'll make a motion.
Speaker C:
If there's no questions, I would move we authorize city manager to execute the license agreement with Birdhouse restaurant.
Speaker A:
Second, any other discussion? All those in favor say aye. Aye. All those opposed say no or nay. The motion carries unanimously. Next, we have an item with regard to authorizing wicked war to accept expand their current liquor license to include additional space.
Speaker D:
Thank you, Mister mayor. Council so, as noted, the wicked ward at 4165 West Broadway applied for and received appropriate licensure for 2024. The reason this is before you here tonight, and again, the motion that we're asking for is to authorize the expansion of the current licensure. If you can think of the property itself, there's two buildings with a patio sort of in between. If you're on Broadway looking at it, that is in entirety one parcel. Some years ago during construction and different uses, the two buildings actually had two different addresses, but that does not mean that they're necessarily separate. I won't go through the entirety, but in section 1200, starting at subdivision zero three, city code considers definitions for things like what the physical space applies to. Further, subsection 21 deals with enlargements or alterations to further encode in 1205.05, outlines for the process, application for the issuance of license, so on and so forth. This is what we're considering, an expansion of the current because within code and then laws, certainly statute and then policy identified by age, the alcohol and gambling enforcement division with the state, they are in agreement that we've followed all protocol needed to go forward with this. I would note much like renewal of liquor license, there is not a public hearing required. A new liquor license does require a public hearing. So that's a question that sometimes comes up. If you can think the most recent Johnny May's lounge. We did require a public hearing, so that's why that one took a little bit longer. But for an expansion or renewal, we don't require that. So all that said, staff is satisfied that we received everything that we need. If council has questions, comments or concerns, I'd be happy to respond. But again, looking for by motion authorization for the expansion of the current licensure related to operations the wicked ward to include additional physical space as presented to the city clerk.
Speaker H:
Oh, I was just curious. Thank you. Mister mayor. Does this include or does the fee change at all for the license or is there like an additional one to expand it?
Speaker D:
Mister mayor. Council. Councilmember Wagner. There is not an additional fee. The fee schedule does speak to certain alterations in this type. We found and made the determination that the expansion really stays continuous to the address that the application was. So maybe to be more explicit, the application, and if you think of the current brewery, is 4165. What used to be the coffeehouse was 4175. And I don't want to say arbitrarily, but was given a postal address to receive mail largely. Some identifying components too as well to that. But to go over and use that space as a part of the liquor license, we're just considering that an expansion and does not fall within a clause that would include a cost.
Speaker A:
Gotcha. So this is an expansion. Where is it expanding to? The parking lot. The old coffee shop. Where is it expanding to?
Speaker D:
Thank you, Mister Mayor. Council. Excellent question. I apologize for not being clear. The expansion would go into the old coffee shop. So that was where the 4175 comes into play. Essentially we've had a letter by the owner presented to us that they won't use it as a part of the marketing area, as a part of the actual contiguous. A good thought that came up through our discussions with age was ensuring things like certificates of liability formally notice what the explicit addresses are. So we'll now be referring it to justice 4165. Both the brewery itself, into the patio.
Speaker A:
Into the old coffee shop and the parking lot. There are events that happened, but those are. That's not part of the license. Those are just special events that you get special approval to use your license for this event out there in the parking lot.
Speaker D:
Yeah. Mister mayor, councils, there are certainly circumstances where special event permits are required. Those would be beyond the continuous physical space as you described, the two buildings in the patio. So if the parking lot. And again, it would depend what it is, but may or may not include council decision. May just be the city clerk. There are additional permits outside of what's being licensed here tonight.
Speaker A:
Okay. Other questions or comments?
Speaker D:
Just one quick one.
Speaker C:
So, with the plan, I don't know the applicant's here tonight, but they would just serve what's currently made in the main building and or what's ever covered by their current license. So just additional seating and serving space, right?
Speaker D:
Yeah. Thank you, mister mayor. Council. Council member Murphy. I think that's spot on. I wouldn't own if of appetite of the council. The applicant is here and can certainly be called upon.
Speaker A:
I have a clear understanding of where. I guess if you want to tell us, Steve, about any change in the business, that's up to you. The 17 people that watch this video will learn about your business. Anything you want to say or not? Yes. So identify yourself. Yeah.
Speaker I:
Steve Carlisle, 4165 West Broadway. It's forever. It's been. Our taxes are 4165. Right. So Hennepin county sees that we're pulling a permit right now for the. From the health department for over there because we still have a coffee. A coffee system in there. Okay. Only thing we're adding is liquor and beer to that. Okay. And that was. That was way back when Marcia did it. Marcia said, that's fine. You guys go ahead and do that. Because we've always been one building, right? And that's how we've always looked at it that way. And then all of a sudden, this came up, and Sam's like, I better check with, you know, Tim. And we did. And. And so basically everything else is 4165. But in you guys records, it's. It's two addresses. And all we're trying to do is get the one address. I mean, the building's gonna be used for, like, book clubs and. And, you know, stuff like that. Just small stuff. People can go in there, use it, whatever. Rent it, whatever. But there'll be, you know, stuff in there for them, you know, so they can have a bartender in there, whatever barista in there, whatever, whatever you're gonna use it for.
Speaker A:
But last year, like, August of last year, I couldn't have a beer in the coffee shop area. Or could I?
Speaker I:
You're good.
Speaker A:
Oh, you could.
Speaker I:
Since we open.
Speaker A:
Okay.
Speaker I:
Yeah. So since we opened Marsha's. Marsha told us that, you know, that you guys can. Because you'd see people walking there with, you know, liquor after we got our liquor license. Beer when we, you know, always had beer. And so that's kind of what we're doing. We're just. We're just making it right with you guys, like we did with Hennepin county. And our permits done right now, I believe. And it's for 4165 for the whole property. But health department came out and looked at that specifically because all we did is we turned the coffee bar 90 degrees, so we had to get a permit to turn that bar 90 degrees.
Speaker A:
Well, thank you for doing that and contributing to the county work.
Speaker I:
All right. So anyway, it wasn't that big a deal.
Speaker A:
Just something small. Okay. Anything else, council members or steve?
Speaker E:
No questions.
Speaker A:
All right.
Speaker E:
Thank you for being here.
Speaker A:
All right, so you're asking for a motion to authorize the expansion of the current licensure related to the operations at the of the wicked ward to include the additional physical space as described here tonight and presented to the city clerk. So is there such a motion? Is there a second? 2nd all those in favor say aye.
Speaker H:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. All those opposed say no or nay. That motion carries. Thank you. All right, next new business. We are being asked to authorize the city manager to execute a professional services agreement with Bolton and Maenck, Inc. So I guess we'll find out what that's about and what the purpose of that is.
Speaker D:
Thank you, mister mayor. Council. So I would just to go back a little bit into 2023, staff made recommendation to the city council that we consider a parks master plan. Think of this as a guiding document, a tenure that would operate in tandem with, like, our CIP. So the capital improvement plan identifies major purchases specific to the parks. You can think of terms of playgrounds, amenities, in some cases, tools or trucks, those types of things that need for the maintenance components. But it doesn't speak to what we're looking to do with the parks master plan and talk about where we're looking to go. Ten years out, everything from recreation to the casual user to more explicit field usages, whether by way of sports or otherwise. Fast forwarding to 2024. After council did approve this as an expenditure in the 2024 budget, the January Parks Rec and Forestry Commission hosted a session really to kick this effort off. The idea was at that meeting to talk at a high level what staff's expectations are. But then staff was able to conduct a swot analysis with commissioners and again, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to better understand the perspective of where we'd like to see parks usage both near and far. I thought a very healthy session. Councilmember Wagner was able to attend and I think appreciated the participation that we had. I would note that we've got a lot of energy with the Parks ReC and Forestry Commission, much like our other commissions. But I frankly, as staff, want to capture that energy and a good way to do that is to put them to work with this kind of thing. That said, we as staff don't necessarily have the bandwidth to take something like this on. So what we did is form an RFP. Staff did receive seven proposals, I should say an RFP request for proposals. We did receive seven proposals, five of which were within the realm of what we were looking to do. Three were interviewed and ultimately staff is now recommending Bolton and Maenck incorporated. I would call out some of the things that we especially liked. They consider current and changing demographics, consider barriers to access, strong emphasis on community engagement, ensure planning to include inclusiveness and accessible features, and promote good stewardship of the natural spaces and parks, or that the parks occupy. Excuse me again, I think the enthusiasm and the energy of the Parks commission is a good representation for some, the ball fields are important for some, the natural elements are important, the walking, the biking space is important to others. So we've got a good variety representative to take part in this process. If selected, what we'll do is we'll establish a timeframe with the hopes of having the parks master plan formally established and presented to council by the end of the year. So certainly a months long process to include a lot of community engagement, which we're excited for. But again, as the mayor noted, we're looking for authorization of the city manager to execute a professional services agreement. But if before we get to that point, you have questions, comments or concerns, I'd be happy to respond.
Speaker A:
Did Bolton and Maenck help us with some of our light rail siting and different questions that we had?
Speaker D:
Mister mayor council, probably the most recent example you're thinking of. They played a role with the stationary planning. They were actually hired by the county, but worked directly with city staff. So as a part of the project buildup, sat with staff on several occasions and presented to you off the top of my head two or three times within the last twelve months.
Speaker A:
Right. And I think they did an excellent, excellent job at that. Any other, you know, I love baseball fields and softball fields because that was my youth and that was my young adulthood. My wife and I and our family, we were in Crystal were the at Becker Park a couple really nice weekends ago, and the softball fields were taken out of there. And they have an elaborate system of what they put in there. And that field was crawling with people, with families and kids. And I want to preserve the fields, but I'm open to any other thing that is more conducive to more people in today's society. Whatever. I guess that's not a plan, but it's just a comment I have.
Speaker H:
Yeah, jump in. Thanks, mayor. Yeah, thanks. Staff, for one, running that parks and rec meeting where this kind of idea was introduced and formulized, and then now to see it more formal here and in front of us is really good to see the expediency of it. Yeah. Like you said, Tim, there was a lot of good energy behind it, and there's a lot of good folks on the Parks commission that are really excited to implement something like this and see it through. And I'm really excited to see what our park system can become because I think it has a lot of potential. And I think the reason that there is a lot of energy on our commission is because those folks also see the potential for those parks as well. So thanks again for doing this.
Speaker J:
I would wholeheartedly agree with that. I think it's been really impressive to see this process play out so quickly. And to Aaron's point, that doesn't happen without a lot of energy behind our commission and also the energy behind staff to help get this RFP out into the world. And it's nice to know that we've had quite a few options to choose from. And I agree with the mayor that Bolton and Menk have been really impressive in our last interactions with them. And I also just want to highlight, I do appreciate staff highlighting the emphasis on community engagement, the environment, accessibility, changing demographics. I think those very well align with the council's goals. So I'm very excited about this and.
Speaker E:
Excited to see more.
Speaker D:
Yeah, agree.
Speaker C:
Happy to support. And what I like about this, excuse me, is a new framework for staff, for council, for residents to plan, which we have not done before. So, you know, in the past, a lot of times it's just replacing playground equipment and kind of keeping what we've had and there's been some new things, but nothing significant. So I think this is, provides that framework to do things differently, think differently. So happy to support. I'll make the motion if that's okay, Mister mayor.
Speaker A:
Go for it.
Speaker C:
I would move that we authorize the city manager to execute a professional services agreement with Bolton and Mink for the. Yeah, that's it.
Speaker A:
Second discussion. All those in favor say aye. All those opposed, no or nay? That motion carries unanimously. Next, we're being asked to consider support for House file number 4182, which is the Equal Broadband act, and that's being authored by Mike Freiberg. I think he's the chief author, so go ahead.
Speaker D:
Thank you, mister mayor. Council, I'll give a brief introduction. I know that this has got the mayor's attention as well as we've gone, but it's noted Representative Friberg is taking a lead with some language. House file 41. We were reached out to we in a couple capacities maintain a formal relationship with CCX, our local cable provider, the Northwest Suburbs Cable Commission. Communications Commission, excuse me, as well as staff, plays a role in some maybe more informal capacities, but was recently contacted as we're in the whirlwind of another legislative session, really at a high level. The legislation that's being considered is much like other utilities that occupy physical space, think in terms of electric and gas. A part of that fee can be recaptured. So as broadband continues to expand in physical spaces, you know, I think the obvious optical ones are Youtland attached to some of our higher water towers, some of our telecoms communication system. As those things continue to expand, they take up space. They require use of certain right away, they require city access, city time. So not only is a part of that, lost in that relationship, a part of the continued expansion of the way people receive services through broadband, excuse me. That is also lost, largely observed through, like our local cable commission. So really what we're looking to do is recapture some of that, to go back to the cable commission, who continue to offer some high quality programming, some the broadcast that people are seeing here tonight is included with that, but again, that those fees typically aren't captured through these new mechanisms. So certainly supporting broadband in the way that we can, but recognizing that the old ways of production and are seeing a negative impact by this, again, house file 4182 was something I just got a first read of. You can see that that's been a part of your packet here. And as loose language, staff just got this at the end of the week, so we didn't have time to put a letter together. But two examples of a couple communities that have supported it is what we would base that language off of. So I'm continuing to wading through it. So I'll do my best to respond to questions, comments, concerns. I know the mayor's had a chance to look at it as well, but would be happy to take direction from council as you see fit.
Speaker A:
So I am supportive of supporting this. I looked at this video that is embedded here in page 45, and I watched testimony, and what we have is a right of way that the cities maintain and support. And we have a cable company that has to pay a certain amount to help us offset those costs. But if you're not going through cable, and this has nothing to do with satellites, by the way, but if you're not going through cable, you're using the right of way anyway because they transmit their things through the wires that are in our right of way. And so this is giving the authority to cities to have a franchise fee, much like the franchise fee that the cable companies pay for using the right of way. The testimony, our attorney, that being the northwest suburbs cable communications Commission attorney Mike Bradley was saying in response to questioning at the hearing that, you know, you have a, the telephone companies that were started before there was any of this type of sort of monopoly, and then they gradually became in the monopoly, but they don't pay a fee. But the, but the cable companies do. And this money that, that we would have the potential to make and the, and the ability to regulate would make it so that any of these companies that aren't cable companies but providing the same services have to build out a city, you know, equally. We could have that authority to do that. And, you know, so that they're not just cherry picking and having the neighborhoods that aren't down in the hollow have services. And it would, you know, be trying to make it so that we could have the ability to franchise and make it so that all the different neighborhoods are built out within a certain time rather than just put in the. On the back burner because of the cherry picking also. So anyway, I support it. This has been amended so that it's limited to 5%, just like our franchise fee for cable is limited to 5%. That was a complaint of some of the people that were against it at the legislature. So they responded to that. Yeah, that's about what I know about it.
Speaker D:
Yeah.
Speaker H:
If I can add some thoughts, too. Thanks, mayor. Yeah, this is excellent. I just joined the very wordy commission, the Northwest Suburbs Cable Communications Commission. And so I've got a tour of the CCX media facility, and it's really impressive. And I think some of the things I want to just emphasize for folks is that just because this is going to be hopefully applied to broadband Internet service, it doesn't mean that CCX Media is going to stay on a cable signal. They've actually already have a huge online presence. A lot of, I mean, I think most of the stuff that they produce ends up on the Internet anyway. So it's not like this is them trying to keep people on an old platform that's not as relevant as it once was. This is to support that local journalism that ends up online and is easily accessible to everybody. When I was talking to the executive director, Shannon of CCX, Shannon Schwartz, she mentioned to me that local sports, like high school sports, all that stuff, youth sports is the most, one of the most popular things that people like to watch on their YouTube channel. And so I think if you're a big advocate and big fan of youth sports, I really think that you should support this or just ask your legislators to support this. And I'm glad we're doing that. And let's see. I think, I mean, the only thing that I would, and maybe I'll make this ask them personally, but I would love them to just clarify instead of just having it be broadband. You know, people get on the Internet through fiber Internet, still on the DSL. Sometimes we stream from our phones through 5G signal. I think expanding that would be maybe a good next step. But this is a great bill. I'm excited that staff and Shannon and the mayor's work on this brought it to us tonight, and that we can offer this letter of support in favor of it, because, you know, we talk about access and being transparent in information and the health and how that translates to a healthy democracy. And you're not going to get local coverage from a better place than a local news outlet. So I'm glad to support this.
Speaker A:
Anybody else? Happy support same.
Speaker D:
Is there a motion, Mister mayor, if I may?
Speaker A:
Yes.
Speaker D:
I might suggest that the motion entertain if appropriate, that the city manager and mayor work together on a letter. I'd be happy to draft something up and take your cues on it, but I would want to do it in the next day or two. So council won't get to see a formal letter, but both in the time spent on the communications and specific to this bill, I think the mayor will have good input and if appropriate, I would suggest that be a part of your motion.
Speaker E:
I'm fine with that.
Speaker A:
Is that your motion?
Speaker H:
Yeah. So I move that we send a letter of support for HF 4182. And that the mayor works with the staff on crafting such a letter.
Speaker A:
Second. Any more discussion? All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
Speaker H:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Aye. All those opposed, say no or nay. That motion carries. Okay, the next item on the agenda is other business, I believe the checkbook register. Is there a motion to approve the payment of the bills?
Speaker C:
I'd move we approve the voucher requests.
Speaker J:
Second.
Speaker A:
I guess that's what's our table. Maybe tonight. Discussion. All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
Speaker C:
Aye.
Speaker A:
Those opposed, no or nay? That motion carries unanimously. Administrative reports.
Speaker B:
Thank you, mayor. Members of the council, I'd like to give another update just with our elections going on, so we had candidate filings for ward two, the open ward two seat open until 05:00 p.m. tonight. We did get five people that applied for that ward seat, and those can be found on our city website of who actually applied and their affidavits of candidacy open. Voting for that will actually begin at the end of March. So March 29 next week. So ward two members can come to city hall and vote early. And then the actual election day will be May 14. And then, like always, if you want continued updates for the city election, make sure to check out the website and our social media. We'll keep updating you on what's happening and new in Robbinsdale. So that is all I have.
Speaker A:
Okay, anything more?
Speaker D:
Thank you, Mister mayor. Council, a few quick updates. We note that the city continues to do some hiring for the summertime. If you're looking to get involved, either in the maintenance side or the recreation side, coaches, camp counselors, trim the grass at the ball fields, those types of positions are open. We also have a couple full time, so always swing by the city's website if you're interested in full time or part time employment. Would note that we've continued a program to get a credit on your utility bill for upgrading appliances. It's something that council just gave the green light to here a week ago to staff, so we'll continue that program again. Give a call to the engineering department or the Bird town brief is a good resource for those updates. Do want to call out on the 9 April at 05:30 p.m. at Elam, the project office for the light rail extension is hosting their next open house, so we will continue to get some information out for that. And then would note finally, the CE and e program that the EDA started here a number of months ago is up and running. Home improvement grants related to certain thresholds, certain work is included, but income thresholds are one of the drivers trying to make those types of home improvement grants and loans more accessible. A lot of great information up on the city website. If it gets too confusing, give us a call, and we'd be happy to walk you through that, but those are up and running, so please take a look.
Speaker A:
Council members, do you have anything starting with Mister Wagner?
Speaker H:
Yes. Thank you, mayor. Have a few things. I just wanted to wish everybody who celebrated a happy St. Patrick's Day on Sunday. It's, you know, I think our history and irish american history is, you know, they've contributed a lot to our country. And just in. Over in Ireland in general, we have the. The shared, I guess, victory of kicking out our monarch. So that's fun to celebrate that. So happy St. Patrick's Day. I received a communication from a resident of mine the other day. They were out on a walk, and they saw some people with a sign that said, you know, God's marriage equals one man, one woman. And they just. They felt really uncomfortable by that, and they wanted me to. And they reached out to me and just asking, like, the city to reaffirm our support for LGBTQ folks. And, you know, I'm only just one council member, so I can't speak for the entire city. I do want to just read something that we, as a council, passed last summer for Pride month. This is just one clause from the proclamation. Whereas all people, regardless of age, gender identity, race, color, religion, marital status, national origin, sexual orientation, or physical challenges, have the right to be treated on the basis of their intrinsic value as human beings, while having the right to feel safe, not be discriminated against, and to live without the threat of harassment. And I just wanted to share that and just reassure that resident and anybody that felt uncomfortable by that sign that you are welcome here. You are safe here, and I'm very glad you're my neighbor. Let's see. I had one other thing. Oh, and I just wanted to thank the award. Two candidates who filed. So thank you for stepping up and jumping in. I've had a wonderful experience up here, and Robbinsville is a wonderful city to serve, and I am excited to work with whoever wins. So best of luck, and, yeah, that's all I had. Thank you, mayor.
Speaker A:
Okay. Thank you, Mister Murphy. Thank you.
Speaker C:
Nothing this evening, Miss Parisian.
Speaker J:
Thank you, Mister mayor. I've got a couple of things. First of all, last week, I was able to attend Mac meeting at the Robbinsdale Police Department building. And Mac stands for the multicultural advisory committee. So I want to thank Mack and also Tim for passing along the invitation. It was a really great meeting, and it was wonderful to meet this group of volunteers who are showing up to build great communication and relationships between the community and our police department. So it was really great to see wonderful presence from our captain and chief there as well. Another fun occasion last week was the annual employee recognition luncheon here at city hall. So it was a really great turnout. It was my first time attending this luncheon, but I think there were more than 50 people, maybe 55 folks, who were there. Really great event, and just highlights all of the talent and expertise that exist on this wonderful staff here at the city of Robbinsdale. So thanks for a great time there. And then also, councilmember Wagner, thank you for sharing that as well. I did also hear from residents about this public display of messages that clearly do not align with Robinsdale's values of promoting inclusion and making residents and visitors and our neighbors feel welcome. So I appreciate you sharing part of that resolution that we passed last year, and I personally feel very proud to contribute to a council that passes resolutions similar to that for Pride month, but then also to have other resolutions that support the LGBTQIA community, such as banning conversion therapy here in Robbinsdale as well. So I wanted to take a moment to express the same sentiments of, I'm so glad you're my neighbor. I love how you put that. And I will continue to work to push forward our council's goals to promote diversity inclusion. So that's all for me. Thank you.
Speaker A:
Thank you. Yeah, thanks for bringing that up, Aaron. And I can't add anything to what you say or make it better other than to say, you know, everybody has freedom of speech and they can talk, and everybody has freedom of religion. And if my religion or some religion doesn't want to have same sex couples get married, that's fine. But as far as the law is the civil law, it doesn't hurt me if somebody is a same sex marriage and they get married. It doesn't know. It's been the Minnesota law for a few years now, and I've yet to have an instance where I thought, oh, wow, that really hurt me. Or that, you know, it just. It leads to stability for families that can be together and have equal rights under the law, have certain benefits, Social Security benefits, eventually survivors benefits, and other kinds of benefits. So it's really a good thing that that is the Minnesota law, and it's a good thing that provincedale supports that. With regard to the lunch. Thanks for bringing that up. The employee lunch. I mean, if there's a way that we can have more things where employees get together. I know we used to have a holiday party in December where people got together and we were just talking about your family mostly and things like that. That would be a thing to do. I think that added a lot of esprit de corps and camaraderie between people and amongst different departments because the little city that we are with, 80 full time employees, still were in silos a lot of the times, and the city council, too. It's a good chance for us to get to know who's in the street department. I mean, I don't have a lot of dealings with them, except if I happen to be out on the streets. So something to consider for the future. But thanks to Sherry or whoever organized this, because it was very smooth, very good. So thank you. And unless somebody has anything else, a motion to adjourn would be in order.
Speaker H:
I move we adjourn.
Speaker E:
Second.
Speaker A:
All those in favor say aye.
Speaker H:
Aye.
Speaker D:
Aye.
Speaker A:
All those opposed say no or nay. That motion carries. We are adjourned.
