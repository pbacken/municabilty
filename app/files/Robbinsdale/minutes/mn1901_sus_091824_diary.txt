Speaker A:
So we will have minutes because that was recommended by the city council and the group will approve those together and then submit them to the council at our following meetings. New business just covers our topic of discussion that are going to be new to the committee. If we want to cover a topic again at a following meeting, that would go under old business. So, for example, at the next meeting, if we want to talk about the logistics again of the committee, that would go under old business. In October's agenda, information only is just another word for updates from me or from members of the committee. So we can usually just go around in a circle and provide some updates to the group and then we'll adjourn. So, pretty simple, we've mimicked this agenda just from our other commissions, and so that's why these headings are the way that they are. Any questions about that? Wonderful. And again, please just interrupt me with questions as they come up. We'll do a roll call, but I know that everyone's here, so we don't have to go through the song and dance of me naming everyone because in just a few minutes you'll introduce yourselves. This is when we would talk about our previous meetings minutes. We don't have any minutes because this is our first meeting, but you will receive tonight's minutes in the October agenda packet. So when you get that on that Friday, you'll have a chance to review them before the next before that October meeting. And at this time, we would vote to either approve them or add some edits, make any updates as we see Fitzhe. And this will be just our topics of discussion every month. So tonight we are going to cover introductions, the logistics of the committee, as well as an overview of city sustainability initiatives. So we'll start out with introductions because I'm assuming that you don't all know each other, which is great. We're going to meet some new friends tonight and hopefully for the rest of, however, the rest of our future meetings, because we'll be working with each other quite a bit indefinitely. So icebreakers can be kind of cheesy. But I wanted to keep this one fairly positive because, I mean, this group already has an inherently positive outlook because you're here and you're excited about sustainability work and we're all doing this together, but I know that climate and sustainability discussions can go south pretty easily. So I just wanted to keep this positive with talking about what we love about Robinsdale. So we'll just go around the circle, say your name and one thing you love about Robbinsdale, and it'll be great. And I guess I can start. My name is Kayla. I'm the sustainability coordinator for the city. I've been in the role for about nine months now. It's a new position that we filled in January of this year, created by the Robbinsdale City Council. Previously, though I've been with the city for about two years. Previously, I was doing communications and sustainability work. So just beginning of this year, those roles split into two, and I took the sustainability role. And my favorite thing about Robbinsdale is definitely the community and getting to work so closely with community members like you all, and just. I wouldn't have this position if it weren't for Robinsdale residents. So that's what I love about Robbinsdale, that there are residents like you all that are. That care about the environment and want to do something about it. So that's really encouraging and just keeps me busy. And Jonathan, would you like to go next?
Speaker B:
Hi.
Speaker C:
My name is Jonathan Hanson, and I guess one of the things I love about Robinsdale is that we're small enough that people like us can have an impact versus what we could have in Minneapolis, where there's just a bunch more people.
Speaker D:
I'm Carol Myers. I'm new to Robbinsdale, lived here for just a year. And what I love about Robinsdale is that it's walkable. I can walk to downtown, and I can walk to the library, and I can walk to a chinese restaurant. And so I like the fact that I don't have to get in my car all the time, and I can walk.
Speaker A:
I love that, too.
Speaker E:
One thing I noticed when I first moved into Robbinsdale is everyone's walking everywhere. But it was how people were. Even if you're just crossing for, like, a split second year, your lives aren't together. There'll be a good morning or good afternoon or hello, and you don't get that in. When I'm visiting my friends in Edina, in Rosemont and Plymouth, you don't get that. And I instantly still to this day, I talk about it with my friends, and they still are like, what? Even the teenagers? I'm like, especially the teenagers. That's one thing I love about Robinson.
Speaker B:
What? Was.
Speaker E:
I exhausted?
Speaker A:
Yes.
Speaker E:
Bear with me. Mardell Pressler.
Speaker F:
All right.
Speaker A:
Hi.
Speaker G:
I'm Sadie Penns Foster. And, yeah, I'm glad you acknowledged, Kayla, that icebreakers are hard.
Speaker F:
I don't like them at all.
Speaker G:
I guess I'll say that I like how Robbinsdale has so many relatively mature trees. My ex husband lives in Dayton, Minnesota, in a relatively new suburb. And there's like, no trees there. It's kind of depressing driving out there.
Speaker H:
I'm Chris Lang. I think one of the things that excited me about Robbinsdale when we moved here was, like, the great potential it has in the city. It's so connected to, like, a larger metro, but still kind of has, like, a lot of room to grow within. So I think there's cool things that could happen in Robinson in addition to the things that are already happening.
Speaker F:
My name is Erin Hart. I've been in Robbinsdale for about seven years, moving here from living about 20 years 2 miles away in Minneapolis. And I think the biggest thing that I noticed was that there is just a profound amount of opportunity to engage and be involved because we are much smaller. But from things like the sustainability committee, from smaller committees, or just like minded citizens that have formed their own. The community garden. My family participates in that. I have an eight year old daughter that's adopted Sanborn park, that doesn't give up. He was very familiar with Penelope. And my Girl Scout troop has been invited to participate. Like, there's just so many different opportunities that when you're living in a larger town or city, there are. There's more money and there's more resources and there are maybe more things, but it's. It's harder to engage and feel like you're making an impact. So that's what I like.
Speaker I:
I'm Nick. One thing I love about Robinsdale is the history, like the tree thing. And I don't know, I just feel like we have a robust history, and this group is sustainability, like, future oriented. But we also have a lot of things to learn from the past. So I like that part.
Speaker J:
My name is Megan. I've lived here for a little over four years now. And one thing that I noticed, having moved from prior Lake, is that people decorate their yards. So fun people, you know, do big yard gardens and clover lawns and just fun stuff. And people are planting trees like this past, I don't know, these past few months where they had the discounted trees.
Speaker F:
Which is really cool.
Speaker J:
I saw a lot of that in my neighborhood. And having grown up in a place where it's all just grass and very stable, sterile, and very hoa y, it was really fun to see all of the diversity and the, I don't know, I guess, commitment to making things beautiful and be friendly and all of that. So drawn a lot of inspiration from that.
Speaker B:
My name is Spencer Greenberg. I have lived here for 17 years. I was born in Chicago and moved here when I was, like, two months old, I think. But one thing that I really love is that I'm able to go and access everything. You were talking about walkable cities, but, like, there's. Not only is it a walkable city, there's, like, things I want to go do around that I'm able to access, you know, for a lot of that stuff, like lakes and downtown and things like that, you know, in other cities, even if they are walkable, the exact thing you want probably isn't around. There's, like, things you can walk to, but it's nothing. It's just the basics, typically. So I thought. I think that's a really cool thing because I like to longboard around.
Speaker A:
Thanks, everyone, for sharing. And it sounds like we have a variety of. You've been here for 17 years. Some people been here for four, as far as I know. Like, we're relatively new to the city. Has anyone been here longer than 17 years?
Speaker E:
I think I've been. It's 2018.
Speaker A:
Oh, okay. Mardell wins. Cool. I like that we have a variety of length of time spent in Robbinsdale. You all have me beat. So. Great. Well, I thought about printing out name tents for tonight, but I didn't want. I wanted this to be kind of an approachable, comfortable, somewhat informal setting. So let me know if something like that would be helpful. Maybe in October. But it's okay if you don't remember everyone's names right off the bat. Okay. So I just wanted to give you all an overview of some important rules and practices that the committee will have to follow from direction from the city council. So the city manager, Tim, included this memo in the agenda packet, just about the Minnesota Data Practices act, as well as the open meeting law rules requirements. Since this is a public committee, we have to host our meetings publicly, and that just means that we give proper notice to the public when we are going to meet. So we couldn't, you know, just arrange to go meet or hang out at the wicked wart. Right. As a committee, we'd have to. Unless, of course, we give proper notice. So. And that just means that. Or, like, a posting on our bulletin board and on the city website or in the bird town brief is sufficient for public notice, but. And there will always be something like that prior to our meetings, but it's also just important to be mindful about communicating with each. Each other. The committee can't really converse and talk with one another as a committee unless it's public and people are properly notified that it's happening.
Speaker E:
So does that also mean with it being published on the website, that people can continue to come, newcomers can still continue to join us for these meetings.
Speaker A:
Um, so right now, I'm going to say, yes, we are. Can still accept new committee members. I need to confirm that with Tim first, because that was kind of unclear to me whether or not there's a. You know, we are. We're capping. We're not capping members, but we. I just don't know how it'll work once we get going and have multiple meetings. But.
Speaker E:
Also, on the flip side, you can break a synergy every time, or people coming, not committing and synergy.
Speaker A:
Yeah, I agree with that. And so I'm intending to confirm that, and I can let you all know.
Speaker G:
Perhaps public notice also imply that people could just come and observe, though.
Speaker A:
Yes. Yep. Yeah. Anyone can just come to this meeting or this meeting and our future meetings as just observers or guests. But I think if there's someone interested in becoming a formal member of the committee, then we'll address that as it comes up, or that's what I'll say right now. But then it's possible that we will cease to accept new members from here on out until we check back in with the city council. Well, yeah, but we're so new, it'd.
Speaker E:
Be good to see some more growth.
Speaker A:
Yeah. So, yeah, that's just a note to be. Keep in mind that in order for the committee to meet, we just need to provide public notice and meet in a public space. We will keep minutes every meeting. I mentioned this earlier, so I don't feel like we need to go into that too much. But I'll be taking those minutes, and we'll just review those as a group at the following meetings. Those will be public record as well, so those will be shared with the council. And, you know, if anyone were to request them from, like, the public or something like that, we would share them. Any questions about those rules? And you can always reach out to me, of course, with questions if they come up. But referencing the Minnesota Data Practices act and the statute that's listed in this memo from Tim will also hopefully provide some answers to your questions as they come up.
Speaker I:
So you'll be doing the minutes and submitting all of that, or will that be like a pass around responsibility?
Speaker B:
Just curious.
Speaker A:
Oh, what? Responsibility?
Speaker I:
Like, it'll be you.
Speaker A:
Oh, yes. Yeah, I'll be. Yeah, I'll be the minutes taker and producer. Yep.
Speaker I:
I just wanted to check.
Speaker A:
Okay, then we will move right into the overview of the city's current sustainability initiatives and again, this is just to level set. I want everyone to be on the same page. And also, I mean, the whole point of this committee is to provide recommendations to the council on new policies, programs, and ideas. But it's important that we understand first where we're currently at before we can, you know, do new things. And you all will also be kind of inherent representatives throughout the community as well. And I'm hopeful that your membership on the committee will spark conversations with your neighbors, your friends, whoever you come across when you're crossing the street and say hello. So I hope that you, I hope that this is helpful for you all, too, to learn about what's going on in the city so that you can then maybe go and share that, too with your neighbors or something like that. You know, hey, did you know the city's already doing this kind of program? Something like that. And of course, this isn't going to encompass every single thing that the city does or has done, but I tried to summarize kind of the big actions and programs that we have in place right now. So the city council really is technically what drives all of this work. So just as a brief overview of kind of where we have gone over the last few years. So I'd say the big thing that sparked action from the council was joining the Greenstep Cities program in August of 2019. That program is a voluntary program for cities and tribal nations to track and report their sustainability efforts. It's based on a set of predetermined actions and metrics. So it's really just a framework for cities and tribes to track what they're doing and identify actions that they could also pursue to grow on their sustainability efforts. So we joined that program in 2019. In 2022, the city joined in with a whole band of other cities to declare climate emergency. The city council has also formally established sustainability action as one of their goals, both in 2023 and 2024. The council sets or adopts formal goals in the beginning of the year. They sit down and decide them as a group and then formally adopt them at a city council meeting. So sustainability has been on that list for the last two years, which is great. And that's also kind of something that's been guiding my work and the formulation of this committee since then. So in August of 2023, the Robinsdale Energy Action Plan was adopted. I know some of you are familiar with that, as you were part of the planning team, but that we'll talk more about that specific plan on the next slide, but that's really our big plan that provides a framework to achieve energy related goals. So some cities might have a climate action plan or a sustainability plan resiliency plan. In Robinsdale, we have the energy action plan, which really intimate. I'll acknowledge it does focus on a very specific piece of the sustainability pie, but it's what we're starting with and it's a really great plan that's going to be guiding my work and a lot of our work for the next seven years, I guess. And then lastly, most recently in 2024, the city council said, we want assistance sustainability coordinator. So we filled that position, or I filled that position in January of this year. The role is brand new. So my everyday duties are really still being molded and shaped. No two days are the same. And it's a lot of figuring out. We're a lot of still figuring out what this role is going to do and what it's going to look like.
Speaker I:
Like.
Speaker A:
But over the last nine months, there's been a large focus on grant work, of course, implementing the energy action plan and now leading the sustainability committee. So next, I'll talk about the energy action plan. This was a major milestone. It's been about. It's been implemented for just over a year, which is huge. So it lays out specific action items that the city can target in order to achieve this goal. That was set by the energy action planning team, which is to avoid an additional 30% of energy related greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to business as usual. So this plan guides a lot of my work, but I think in the coming year, I would really like to use it as more of a driving force. There's just a lot going on and I think that the fact that the city council adopted this plan, this is for the entire city. I think that that can be relied on more heavily than it has been in the last year. So if you get a chance to review the energy action plan, I would highly, highly recommend it because it's very informative on, you know, where, where we're at in terms of our energy use right now. It talks about the planning process, talks about the group meetings that we had and how we identified a lot of these goals. And you can also read about the different actions and such that the plan sets out to achieve.
Speaker B:
Is it a publicly available thing?
Speaker A:
Yep. Yes, it's on the website. Yep, it's on the city website. I believe there's a sustainability page on the city website and it's linked on there.
Speaker B:
The website is like, actually so difficult.
Speaker A:
To navigate the website. Yeah, I will say that we will have a new city website in maybe January this week. Perfect.
Speaker B:
Yeah. Yeah, that's. I was going to suggest on this because it's, like, so difficult to navigate.
Speaker A:
Yep. We are in the process. Right. Our communications coordinator is in the thick of putting, creating a new website for us. So that'll be very exciting. Launch in the new year. All right. Oh, and here's. Okay, this energy. The energy action plan, like I said, has been in the implementation phase for officially over one year now. So just wanted to highlight some of the outcomes of that over the last year. And I will say that almost all of these can be attributed to our Minnesota Green Corps member, Noah, who was serving with us from September of last year through August of this year. They serve 11th month, eleven month terms. And his focus really was just energy active plan implementation. So he accomplished a ton of work out of that, and he was incredibly, incredibly helpful in this first year of the energy action plan. So we have done a lot of outreach and engagement about the energy action plan with different businesses, multifamily housing, rental housing in Robbinsdale, nonprofits, faith based organizations. We have worked with the Chamber of Commerce and presented at their meet monthly luncheons. Noah put together an awesome case study recently about a resident's home. A resident who has outfitted her home with solar and EV Charger, and I completed a home energy squad visit. So that was really fun to put together. And that's kind of like one of the actions of the energy action plan was to create a case study to hopefully share with other residents to see, oh, yeah, maybe that's something that I could do on my home. So it was really great to see that put together and published, put out into the world. We try to get out to a lot of city events to talk about the energy action plan and get folks connected to different resources and programs, things like that. So there's been a lot of outreach over the last year about the plan and programs and ways that we can save people money, things like that. Hopefully you have seen that we are in the process of installing two new solar arrays on our city buildings. So we have solar panels officially on the water treatment plant. The construction is complete. I think the remaining phase of that project is just to get excel involved and have them connect the panels to the grid so that one is almost complete. And that's been really, really fun to see come together. There are actual solar panels on the roof of the water treatment plant.
Speaker E:
That would be great to see how much revenue it brings back to the city.
Speaker A:
Yeah, it'll take a bit for there to be. I think the break even point was maybe eight years, but the IRA tax credits are. It would be even longer without the IRA tax credit. So that's been a huge benefit to the city, is the IRA. And on city hall, we'll have a array going up soon thanks to a grant from the Minnesota Department of Commerce. And we've also been subscribed to a community solar garden since 2019. So that allocation goes to the public safety building and the water treatment plant as well.
Speaker I:
Do you know which community solar card is the xl one, or is it a different.
Speaker A:
The owner is potentia renewables. It's out in St. Michael.
Speaker I:
Okay, cool.
Speaker A:
Okay. Yeah. Okay. Another exciting program that we have implemented this year is the free home energy squad visits. And again, thanks to NOAA, we were able to secure some grant funding to offset the cost of those visits for residents. So right now, the number of visits that we were able to offer for free is limited because it's grant funded. But this program has been so wildly successful that I am really hoping to pitch to the council that we should fund this. Twenty four seven. And the benefits of completing a home energy squad visit are incredible. So I have been really, really impressed with how well residents have received this and just how many folks have already completed a visit. And if any of you haven't done one yet and would like a free home energy squad visit, then please scan the QR code.
Speaker F:
Yeah, if you have an older. So we did ours for the summer, and we had scheduled it, and they actually called several times because they had so many openings where they could have come earlier, which was great. Our neighbor across the street did hers, and we were both, like, blown away at how comprehensive it was. I think the case study that they did was maybe blue.
Speaker A:
Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker F:
I 100% think that we should do more case studies.
Speaker A:
Okay.
Speaker F:
Like, definitely at work. I do case studies. That's why I'm a super proponent of those. But they, like, we're super comprehensive. And I know Lou talked a lot about what they did for me. I was a little bummed because our score, our house was surprisingly already pretty efficient. It was like a 97 out of 100. Okay. However, they gave us very actionable items that we could complete. They did not come in and say, yeah, your windows are older. You should just replace them all, because they're like, if you have 40 grand that you want new windows, you could, but you already have double pain. The amount that you're going to spend, you will never, ever return that investment. I was like, oh, it's funny because all the remodelers tell us we we should, and it's going to improve so much. He's like, of course they are. But, like, I am factually telling you, that's not what you need to do if you do want to do things. Here are the five things you could do. And then things like in our bathroom that doesn't have the fan. And we've looked at them. He's like, here's a really cool one that you can put in. It's efficient. A lot of just regular, you know, contractors would know about it, like, so they gave us tips that we could do. They did things like, if there was a light bulb that was an led, they replaced it for free. They did new ceiling. Like, sealed around our front and back doors for us, around a couple windows. Edge of a few hours. There is, like, you have to. Depending on the age of your home, there's a blow test that they do. Like a blower test. So you have to sign up for the right one. Our neighbor across the street got a free digital thermostat installed. Like, it just went up to the truck and got one and installed it. I will say when I tried to sign up, it took me several tries on the website because I kept getting bounced back because it said I wasn't qualified, like, due to income requirements. And I was like, well, I know for sure that they're free in Robbinsdale. And I was like, maybe I waited too long and the 50 are gone. But I said, no, that's weird because I know that they said there were some. And so I called. So I don't know if maybe other people are going to the website and experiencing that same barrier and then just giving up and being like, oh, well, I don't want to pay the 100 or 150 or whatever it is, even though that is, like, still a really good. Knowing what I got are both options for you.
Speaker B:
And my family just got one. I didn't hear a ton about it beyond them just telling us about, like, some stuff with our heating and cooling. I was in school, so. And also how my cat was.
Speaker F:
Oh, they scan the animals. Did you get that? Oh, yeah. Because I talked to your dad at national laid out, and I showed him our audit.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
So they cringe you. They mail you an audit with, like, so many photos. They measure, like, the thickness of your insulation inside and out. They sent a picture. They're like, oh, here's the heat scan on your cat and your dog, which.
Speaker B:
Is like, they did not heat scan my cat. They had to. She's like three and she really likes to run around.
Speaker F:
Yeah.
Speaker B:
I think it would be hilarious for them to try and get a heat scan on all my animals because I have, like, 50.
Speaker F:
Well, it was funny because in the audit, there's, like, our animals. But they said a very comprehensive report.
Speaker B:
That's.
Speaker F:
We had it at our. We had ours done, like, the week before national night out. So when we're setting up the tables, because I coordinated our block, I printed a couple copies of our audit, and then I printed, like, the information on the home energy squad with QR codes. I'm like, how to go in and sign up? And then I printed the, like, I put the link, like, the link was on there with the QR code. And then I also wrote the phone number and said, it's really easy if you just call included, how it was free. And then anyone that walked over was like, guys, have you done this? And no one on our block except for me and my neighbor Britt across the street had done it. So we were just, like, telling everyone how they had to do it. And so we were definitely promoting it to everyone. So I told your dad about it, and you have to do this. How. How is everyone not taking advantage of this? So we were talking about that. So I thought that was one really good way to engage. I did try to. I did print one other thing. I think it was maybe about. I don't know, it wasn't the water efficiency rebate. I think it was the home improvement grant info. I tried to find whatever I could because I had printed stuff on registering to vote and, like, the elections, you know, like world War two.
Speaker A:
This was just for your national night out?
Speaker F:
Yeah. Like, I did an info table with, like, all the things just for people to know.
Speaker A:
Thank you.
Speaker B:
Are you. You're not on my street. That was. It was just my dad who was, like, wandering around.
Speaker F:
Yeah, we're in the same word.
Speaker B:
Yeah, because he was going around all the blog parties. Yeah, I remember that.
Speaker F:
BFF's with Jason outside. He's like, Spencer's in there. It's like, cool. But we were like, so anyone in town? And you guys all. I wasn't personally there when it was done, but my husband was very impressed. He's like, I don't know. I thought they'd be in and out and tell us, like, we had to do all this stuff. I was disappointed because I was convinced I was going to get all of these tips and actionable items so that I was going to cut my energy bill. In half, which isn't going to happen. However, they did give us, like, real actionable things we can do. And then the items that we did want, like the fan in the bathroom and a couple of other items. They have contractors that are, I don't know, energy squad. Like, ones that can come out and they can actually quote on site and, like, they recommend working with them for. Because they're, I guess, experience with this kind of work. So we haven't done anything yet, but.
Speaker H:
You know, when they came to our house, he walked me around while they were doing the blower door test.
Speaker F:
Yeah.
Speaker H:
You can see all the air infiltration with that thermal camera. And I do a lot of the work on our house. And so he was just like, you could show me where all the air was coming in still.
Speaker F:
Yeah.
Speaker H:
Because they negative pressure your house. And so he was like, just run a bead of cock around there. And he was just showing me all these, like, real simple things to make my house a lot more airtight.
Speaker A:
Isn't it great?
Speaker F:
Yeah. Like, different ways to do insulation, like, in the crawl space or. And there's just a couple, I don't know, like, ballast, like, in the basement and different crawl spaces.
Speaker A:
He's like, oh, yeah.
Speaker F:
Like, look at right here, the picture. I was like, whoa.
Speaker E:
Looks like a lot of energy's escaping right there.
Speaker A:
It's nice to hear these real life experiences. I haven't done a home energy squad visit because I don't own a house, but I don't live in a house. I rent an apartment, but I'm hoping to get some more feedback, like what you two just shared about some of the experiences that our residents have had getting their free visit, so that we can use that to pitch to the.
Speaker F:
Council, like, permanent funding.
Speaker A:
Yeah, I'm gonna. I'm gonna try that will actually be a. Right now tentatively planned to talk to the. Actually, the EDA is. The Robinsville Economic Development Authority is who would technically be. Be within their budget. So I'll be talking to them at this, their meeting in October about expanding the program.
Speaker F:
So how did we get the free. The grant to get this seed grant?
Speaker A:
So that. Yeah, that's from the clean energy resource teams, which is an awesome organization in Minnesota. I do a ton of work with them. It was Noah and I that applied for that. They do it annually in the beginning of the year.
Speaker F:
And is it like, once we've tapped out our 50 or, like, applied once, then that's all we can do? Or could we be guaranteed, like, every year we get 50 and then the city would actually subsidize, like, any additional free ones, because, I mean, once a resident has it, you really don't need it again. But maybe it's something like, when we have you. Because when people move to the city as new homeowners, you have to come to city hall to do, like, you know, to pick up your packet and get your garbage can stickers or whatever. Maybe it's something we like. That's as a first point of, like, inform. There's something you can do. So it's like, it would be really cool to have a goal of, you know, by. I know we can't mention the energy plan, but, like, hey, what if in five years, you know, even if half the homes or 25% of the homes had completed a home energy squad or something? And it's like, if we have, you know, even, like, let's say, in the national night out packets that you pick out, because there's all that information that you can provide, it's like, well, here's the QR code.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
Here's a printed. Here's a case study. Here's a sample of one of the audits so people can sign up there. New residents are informed at the time, like, they move in, and then when the home energy squad is, like, you know, gives you, they mail it maybe, like, four or five days after you completed it, if we have a link there, if they could somehow partner with us, and that's how the person could give feedback that would come back to the city that we could use to share our people's stories.
Speaker A:
I love the idea of some sort of, like, packet of information that residents receive, either when they move in. I mean, there's. We'd be barely scratching the surface if we just sent them to people that are just moving in. Like, if we could. Mailing costs a lot of money, so it's expensive to send mailer mail to every resident, but, yeah, other ways to reach.
Speaker B:
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Is, like, an updated website type of thing, making that something accessible to see.
Speaker A:
Mm hmm, mm hmm.
Speaker F:
Maybe like, home improvement stores, because.
Speaker A:
Oh, yeah, yeah, actually. So Noah did do that. He brought some flyers over to ace earlier this year, and so they had info about the home energy squad visits. They had flyers about the water rebate program. I think even the home improvement grant program is a list of things.
Speaker E:
I mean, like, I think a lot of us, decades ago signed up for the Saverswitch because that was huge, huge promotion on that. But I think there's new homeowners coming in might not be familiar with it. I get the sense they're not familiar with it. So that'd be great. On the website when they updated that the page for sustainable has all the. All these programs, a list of all this programs and the links to go and to check it out to apply.
Speaker F:
For it could be like, what's new with us as a committee? And then like, are you new to us? Everything you need to know. Start here if you want.
Speaker E:
Everything.
Speaker I:
Do we know businesses qualify for energy audits? Like, I'm.
Speaker A:
That.
Speaker I:
The energy action plan. That's the one thing that I always get to. It's like the businesses are the ones that are emitting the most.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker I:
Obviously, like, residents say money on their bills is great, but, like, is there a way to get businesses to, like, check out their energy?
Speaker A:
Yeah. Yep. Businesses can get audits, too. We did. We spent a day back in August going door to door to get businesses signed up for an audit. I believe those are still. It's not called the home energy squad, but it's still Ce. Yeah. Ce does the administers program. They have the. It's the one stop efficiency shop, so. And as a result, after following that day that we did all the direct outreach, the folks at the one stop efficiency shop have been following up with all the businesses that we visited to actually get them signed up. So. Working on that, too. But, yeah, there's definitely more outreach to be done.
Speaker C:
Kind of to his point. I wonder if, you know, every two years when landlords have to renew their rental license, if an energy audit could be part of that, and then we could phase in some kind of minimum requirement.
Speaker A:
Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker E:
Tim Sandback, he brought that idea to the table.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker E:
I think he's already thinking of it. I think I'm thinking.
Speaker A:
Right.
Speaker E:
Double thinking.
Speaker D:
That's great.
Speaker E:
I think he's already on that, actually.
Speaker A:
But to see it formalized somehow, it would be complicated. But we could. We could do it.
Speaker E:
Tim can get it done if he wants to. And I have a feeling he wants to.
Speaker A:
Yeah. And we have a new community development director that I think would want to do something like that as well.
Speaker E:
But it's also to do that mindfully. We would have to have some sort of support. Financial support.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
For the landlords.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker E:
Because I don't want to be known as that city, as strong army people and they having to fold and go somewhere else.
Speaker A:
Yeah. So I think the really, the main goal here is to just expand the free home energy squad audits first, and then if we can just make that a permanent program, like a bunch of other cities in the metro. That is going to be a great start. And then. Yeah, ideally, eventually work it into rental property, landlord requirements, and businesses, things like that. Yeah. So a nice segue to our next program is the Home improvement grant program. I don't directly oversee this program, but I wanted to include it just because it's an important one. So this was a new grant program that the Robinsdale EDA implemented this year. So this also is in partnership with CEE, the Center for Energy and Environment. So this is. This gives grants to Robinsdale residents for all sorts of home improvements, but this includes things like the addition of solar panels, EV charging stations, heat pumps. If your home energy squad audit directed you to replace all your insulation, you could apply for a home improvement grant to help offset some of those costs. So.
Speaker E:
So the grant. I think I applied for the grant, but then I was told it was more of a rebate, so I was confused. Well, yeah, but I applied for the grant, so why. Why were they saying it's only gonna be like a rebate?
Speaker A:
Why they.
Speaker E:
Why are they telling me it's a rebate when I apply for a grant? I was confused by that.
Speaker A:
Um, so I'm not exactly sure why they would say that. They told you that? I mean, did they, like, accept your application?
Speaker E:
10% rebate. And I'm like, well, I thought I was applying for a grant.
Speaker A:
I wonder if that's a cee staff person. I don't know if we have.
Speaker I:
I was going to mention there's also a state home improvement grant. Have you seen that one? I think it's better than this one. It can cover what? Much more? Like up to $60,000.
Speaker F:
And I don't know that it has the income limits.
Speaker I:
It doesn't have an income limit, and I believe it's like. Like a subsidized interest rate.
Speaker A:
So it's like, very. I was not aware of that. And hearing that there's no income limit is especially nice.
Speaker G:
Just for specific things. It's not as broad and what you can.
Speaker I:
I think it's about as bad as this. I think. I don't think the windows are on there, but I know heat pumps and solar panels.
Speaker G:
Yeah, someone did with solar panels.
Speaker I:
I can check on this.
Speaker A:
I think that would.
Speaker B:
I know that states have, like, native lawn grants, too, especially if you live by wetland. They have, like, a big thing for that. They, like, really want people to do, like, wetland restoration. So for people who live on Crystal Lake and such, that might be something relevant or just for Crystal Lake management in general. There are bigger grants for that, like with the state government and I think some of them are national too.
Speaker F:
We did that one right to get a little money for.
Speaker A:
What grant was that?
Speaker F:
That was a lawns to lagoons. You apply. And then it took us like we didn't get it the first year. Then we applied again. It was either the second or third year, but we got it and it was up to $300 for natives. And you can put it towards grass and native plants. There's a very. And you have to submit receipts, you get linked. It's a pretty cool program. You get set up with like a metro, you can talk with. They have webinars, it's pretty specific on where you can shop. So even if it's like, oh, this is a polymer, this is a native. It's pretty tricky. And be lawn mixes sometimes have things that aren't quite native. So they give you really good resources. Like we bought all our stuff at Mother Earth garden. They were a great resource, but it's great. And there's our neighbor across the street. Street is doing a rain garden. It's a way to like track water from one area to another to like help.
Speaker B:
Yeah, we have a big huge rain garden at my school. It's massive. Yeah.
Speaker F:
So that's another.
Speaker E:
And yeah, it'd be great if someone could. Well if you, you know, email the group.
Speaker A:
So true. Yeah. More of those like natural resource heavy grants and programs I'm less familiar with because so much of my work right now at least is surrounding the, the energy action plan and energy efficiency and things like that. Our forests.
Speaker B:
Yeah, I know a lot more about the natural resource grants because that's a lot more of the work that I do. I've done like several internships through that kind of stuff. And then obviously like my school is very, very involved with that. So I've learned a lot about the different grants you can get, especially for like native lawns and stuff, and then pollinator preservation things.
Speaker A:
You can keep us all informed.
Speaker B:
A lot of other cities that I've seen, not necessarily something we need to implement, but maybe more like as a resource, have information about ways to create sustainable lawns and they don't. It's not a grant thing, it's just like a information session you can attend about it. So a lot of them are online things, but they tell you about the native places that you can put in your garden. They tell you about native lawns for like people who want to learn more about it, but don't necessarily want to go get a grant for it yet.
Speaker A:
I love the idea of some sort of webinar for residents like that.
Speaker B:
Yeah. So like if we were to use one of the other ones from the other cities, create our own, either way, like that kind of thing I thought was really cool.
Speaker F:
U of M is a good resource.
Speaker A:
Yeah. Yeah. Our city forester, he's our city forester and natural resources specialist. He is super educated on.
Speaker E:
Is that Danny Sussman or Stephen?
Speaker A:
No, that's Stefan. Yep. Stefan Papitz.
Speaker E:
That's okay.
Speaker A:
Yeah, Stefan Papitz. He is super informed and educated on all things lawn care and native plants. And we can, yeah, we could definitely have him come to a future meeting.
Speaker B:
And I know he knows a lot about emerald dashboards.
Speaker A:
Yeah. But we could certainly work more with him to get information about these programs and such out to our residents.
Speaker B:
For sure. Yeah.
Speaker E:
In the beginning, just here, we could have a Google Docs spreadsheet and have like different topics, you know, not topics but headpoints. And if you could just fill in the grants, the programs, just like a.
Speaker B:
Spot to put links, basically category like.
Speaker E:
This, like lawns, solar windows, whatever, home improvements.
Speaker B:
And it would be just four grants of, or for like any relevant information to link to it, like anything we talked about.
Speaker E:
That's a good point. So grants, rebates and just information.
Speaker B:
Yeah, because like, I was talking about those, the like little class things. Like there's a link to that. I could put that.
Speaker A:
Yeah, I mean, ideas like that, like projects, I don't really want to call them projects, but like a project for things like that. That, that it's a perfect example of something that the committee could do and it's a tangible outcome and product that we can then go and share with the council and hey, this is what we're spending our time on. But also that is a resource for me and other residents too. So I think that's a great idea and certainly something that the committee could tackle if we want to as a.
Speaker F:
Group, if we kind of, like, I can envision if we. Because I think there's a lot of. I think we determined there's a lot of need for awareness.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
Within the city. So we have kind of a vision of first we need, you know, just to increase awareness.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
And then once we increase just the awareness, it's like, okay, so now people know and it's like, well, now they know, then it's like, well, what do we want them to do? So then it's like, well, we have a call to action. It's like, so now, you know, and I do not need you to do this thing. And then we need them to, like, drive adoption, so get them to do it more. And then we need them to be promoters and, like, help us push that work forward, I think, like, first knowing. Okay, so we need to raise awareness, something like this. Well, here's all the resources. And where do we want to go first? Things like, well, we already know we have access to money and resources and this other place that's doing the home energy visits, let's like, start there because we can easily raise awareness. We already have a call to action of what to do. Like, that's like a fast track. Like, let's start there and then maybe this, like, then what's our kind of a stretch? Or like, oh, cool. What could we develop? Well, maybe we have a, you know, this, you know, if you want to develop, like, thought leadership would be like, well, where. Where is our center of knowledge? Like, if you want to be very active or to know everything there is to know about how to be the most green, sustainable person, where would we have this hub of information? Like, we. I think starting, like, let's start a center of information that we can all share and start pooling our resources. But what would that look like if we did, like, if we did socialize that out, you know, to the community on our glorious website?
Speaker B:
Yeah, I think having a section for resources on that with the new website would be good. Do you know, like, the person who's creating that or how that's going?
Speaker A:
The website? Yeah. Yep. I work pretty closely with our communications coordinator because she. She does all the.
Speaker F:
I think we're doing it. She's doing it here, like, in house?
Speaker A:
Well, she. We're working with Civic plus is the. Is the. Going to be our new website host. So she's working directly with consultants and their world, too. Yeah, so they're doing a lot of the, like, design and back end stuff. Rachel's doing a lot of the organizing right now of our current website and kind of clearing out content, things like that.
Speaker B:
But, yeah, I think I like what you were mentioning earlier. Like, there are areas of land that are very, like, they could use some form of, like, native restoration type of thing. I would like to look into that at some point because that's, you know, more of my thing. I know that. I know a good amount about the plants. I know a lot about the animals around, and a lot of what I see, like, there's specific, isolated areas where there's a lot of diversity in native plants, but a lot of it is just Kentucky bluegrass, as far as the. I can see.
Speaker A:
You should reach out to our. To the city forests, or I will.
Speaker B:
My dad has told me to, and I've asked him to just for, like, to bring it up, because I don't know if everyone knows, but I'm Spencer Greenberg. My dad is Jason Greenberg, and he's the city councilman for ward two. So that's my whole thing. I will probably bring up my dad a lot. And it's not just like, oh, he's my dad. I'm gonna talk to him about everything. No, he's on city council, so at least as of right now, I think we. Well, he's gonna run again in December, I think, whenever that is. He's. Until December.
Speaker A:
Yeah, November 5.
Speaker F:
November 5.
Speaker B:
Well, that's when the vote is. But he runs until December. Until the next term.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker B:
Yeah. Anyways. Yeah.
Speaker C:
So I think one thing is that there's all these resources, but it's overwhelming.
Speaker A:
Absolutely.
Speaker C:
I think, to Aaron's point earlier, that having case studies helps people actually kind of see what the process would be like, and they could see themselves doing that.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker B:
I'd like to talk more with that.
Speaker E:
Lady you mentioned, and just being that friend.
Speaker A:
Lou would probably love to talk to you about her. Solar.
Speaker B:
Yeah, the. That kind of case study thing. Because I know how solar works. Because I have a class about sustainable architecture. I. The vast majority of people I meet are like, hey, solar panel. Solar panels create energy for this house. I know nothing beyond that. I think having an informational source about, like, hey, this is how people actually do solar. These are grants that you can use for solar, like that kind of thing. So it doesn't feel like such a unattainable step.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker H:
Are the case studies, like, reports, or are there multimedia? Kind of like, are there any videos that we could do?
Speaker I:
Some posted a video on them.
Speaker H:
Cool.
Speaker I:
It's like a three minute, three, four minute video.
Speaker A:
We. Yeah, we worked with CCX to put together a video. Oh, yeah, no, similar. Um, yeah, so we do have a video about Lou and her house. Um, and also just like a PDF, one pager about it.
Speaker D:
Um, yeah, I have a heat pump and solar panels. So I talked to, uh, everybody that great about heat pumps and solar panels.
Speaker F:
And did you do that right when you moved in?
Speaker D:
Yes.
Speaker F:
Okay.
Speaker D:
I did that right when I moved in.
Speaker F:
Okay, let's do case study.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker D:
And then I tell people, they say, so what do you pay your energy. I'm like, hardly anything. I said, I have a $50 credit from XL and, you know, basically.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker D:
You know, so I just really promote that, you know? And a lot of people have never.
Speaker A:
Heard of heat pumps, right?
Speaker D:
I mean, they know about solar, but they don't know about.
Speaker A:
Heat pumps are new. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker D:
Well, they aren't really.
Speaker A:
Yeah, they're not new. They're not new. They're growing cold weather heat pumps.
Speaker D:
Yeah. But, you know, a lot of people really don't know about heat pumps. So I just talk to everybody that I meet about my home.
Speaker A:
Good. Thank you.
Speaker E:
Really important about a case study is getting route is doing the broad, but then narrowing down how much it's costing you, how much it's saving you.
Speaker F:
Just everyone, really.
Speaker B:
I mean, if y'all wanted. I mean, this is not a specific to Robbins Dale thing, but my school is like a larger, very large institution that has, like, large scale solar has large scale. I think if I know what you guys are talking about with heat pumps, which is the, like, water running through to basically produce. I don't know, it's like the coal air from outside that runs against hot water in a pump type of thing.
Speaker D:
Yeah.
Speaker B:
Is that what, like, for heating? Yeah, they. That's like a very. That's the primary source of heating at my school. Like, we've done talked to, like, the engineer. Like, if y'all wanted a case study for businesses, hospital, like the hospital and stuff like that. But that isn't just, hey, here's a house. Okay. What are we supposed to do? We're like five times as big as the house.
Speaker F:
We can find out which businesses, because they'd have to have a permit to get the work done. So we could do a little snooping. Right. And find out who's had the heat of business.
Speaker B:
Yeah. But I can talk to my. I can talk to my sustainable architecture teacher because I think he would be so down for that.
Speaker F:
Let's get some experts.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
So did you have this boat at your previous house?
Speaker D:
No, I lived in a condominium, so. No. So I have a, you know, a house now. And as soon as we moved in, we had center point put in the heat pump and another company put in solar.
Speaker E:
See, that's when I was house hunting. I was planning on moving to Tucson that didn't fall through, but I was really excited about these houses that need to be fixed up. And the realtor is like, why? That's exactly why I was excited about buying a house that needed a new ac system.
Speaker D:
Yeah. And then I tell people how this actually. And some people will say, wow, so you're really helping the environment, too. Not only is it like a financial, you know, benefit, that's really how you sell a lot of this.
Speaker E:
And isn't your house more comfortable also because you're not feeling like you have to turn it down or up?
Speaker D:
The temperature is always consistent, like there's not these fluctuations like heat or air conditioning? Yes, it's like, you know, always consistent. And that's, like, the first thing that I noticed.
Speaker A:
These are really great. I feel like I need to be, like, quoting you. I need to be quoting you. Want to give me a raise? What I'm taking away from all of this is that we could hugely benefit from more communication and education and just general information about heat pumps, the different technologies, and what options are available for residents.
Speaker I:
I do this for a living, for citizens, utility board, educating groups of people like home improvement things. My worry for this group, though, is what's being done. How many furnaces are being installed right now with residents that don't understand cost saving measures that they can do, like home energy squad or heat pump technique? We have code, like, really outdated code, things that we should probably get to at some point that we can prevent rhapsodic residents from just, like, being energy burdened, essentially. So I don't know. I think we should keep going with the presentation. There's a lot to talk about wise, but, like, we have some really serious things to get to at some point.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker I:
And heat pumps are, like, really important, but they're not gonna say, like, save the climate problems that we're facing.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker I:
Sorry, I don't mean to be dark, but I'm, like, kind of frustrated. You have a lot to get to.
Speaker A:
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, these programs are by no means a solution to the world's problems, but it's a start and an indicator to you all that not nothing is going on, you know, at city hall where you have some things. So, on that note, lastly, last program that I'll talk about is our water efficiency rebate program that we've had offered since 2020 or so. Again, this one is. It's low hanging fruit. It's quick, easy money for folks, for residents to get. If they are already planning to replace a washer or dishwasher or shower head or toilet. If you replace it with a energy star or watersense certified appliance, we'll give you up to $100 as a credit on your utility bill. So, again, it's nothing, you know, huge, but it's a really simple way to incentivize more efficient appliances. And I think implementing more programs like this would be great to give people that financial incentive to make home improvements and also just get people on board. People love saving money. That's like the huge driver for this kind of work. So I just wanted to bring this program up in case you are not all aware of it already.
Speaker F:
But these are important because these are the small things that you get them started on.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
If you get them started on something that is easy to do immediately, immediately beneficial, then it's like, oh, my God, that was so easy.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
I'm instantly saving money. Okay, now I'm gonna start talking. Now I'm gonna do an ev. Now I am on board to, like, talk about solar and. Yeah, things that, like, everyone can on board.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
We can finally move the needle and we don't have these leg guards being.
Speaker D:
Like.
Speaker F:
This is how you get people to get toes who are not so forward thinking because not everyone is just going to go and wire their garage.
Speaker A:
Right.
Speaker I:
So I feel about composting, too. I know we're getting to that, but, like, the composting program is at least getting people to think about.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker A:
Yes. That is a great. It's a great segue to solid waste. I didn't want to, you know, talk about our sustainability efforts without bringing up recycling and organics recycling, because that's a huge service that the city provides. That is such a large pillar of sustainability. But I think it's one that often just kind of gets overlooked just because it's something that has been a part of life, especially recycling organics. Recycling is newer. Or composting. I'll just call it composting. So that's easier. Composting is newer to a lot of folks, but, you know, recycling, we've been recycling for a long, long, long time, and that's just something that people are used to now. So we have had a huge increase in the number of residents that compost, thanks to the new requirement that everyone pays for it. Sorry if that upsetted you, but. Or upset you. Yeah, yeah. There were a lot of unhappy. Now you can. Now you can throw your pizza boxes. Throw your pizza boxes in your cart. Yeah. So that's a. I was putting them.
Speaker H:
In my neighbors for free and they.
Speaker A:
Were putting, oh, great.
Speaker H:
So we had, like, a share going.
Speaker C:
Yeah, I was doing that, too.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker H:
Now we have our own bed.
Speaker F:
740 participants is how many within the city there are now.
Speaker A:
Yes.
Speaker F:
Adapted.
Speaker H:
How many total residences are there in the city?
Speaker E:
I think there's only three on my block that weren't participated.
Speaker A:
That number has increased by, like 400 since the new implementation of the new, of the everybody pays policy.
Speaker D:
So, yeah, so I posted on next door neighbor because I noticed there weren't very many compost ins and neighborhoods where I walk around and, whoa. I was prepared for some backlash. And I definitely got the backlash. Yeah, I did. There were a lot of people who are very angry because they have to pay for this and, you know, and about the increase in rates, and they don't want trucks going up and down their street. And some people, they do it in their backyard and it's free, but you can't put everything in, you know, in your backyard. Some people said, thank you for doing this, and I'm waiting for my bin. But I had to stop reading those responses because they were so ugly and nasty that I just, like, shut it. It off. But it wasn't pretty. It wasn't pretty.
Speaker H:
They had a sign that was pro blue line extension and that was, like, the comments I got.
Speaker B:
Every. At a certain point, I just stopped going on bird town on it because people were being, like, bullying my dad.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker B:
Because he's like, not. He's not anti blue line.
Speaker A:
Breakdown. Unedited is a scary place.
Speaker C:
Your dad has a pretty balanced perspective.
Speaker B:
Exactly. No, exactly. I feel like he's reasonable, like, from what I've heard. And not just because he's my dad.
Speaker D:
Like, I don't have to get one. You can always just bring your compost over. And it's amazing because I have. I produce so little actual trash. In fact, even last week, I didn't have enough in my trash to put my bin out to sleep. You know, it's mainly plastics, of course.
Speaker I:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
And your kitchen garbage is not all smelly and gross.
Speaker D:
I mean, it's, you know, amazing. And I only put, like, two or three bags in. Of course, they're really compacted. But that is. Yeah.
Speaker F:
When the bears and vermin and raccoons, like, are not taking over your house producing methane.
Speaker J:
I do think that, you know, maybe a drawback for people is just the cost of the compostable bags we have. We started when, once we got that big, I think it was a piece of mail.
Speaker F:
I don't know where they sent it out.
Speaker J:
And I said, well, yeah, we're gonna do this. And I went online and saw what people were recommending for compostable bags. And it's, you know, $20 for a bag of bags. And that's an expense.
Speaker A:
Yeah. Like, that's that's not nothing.
Speaker J:
You know, I can go to Costco and get 300 bags for $20. And so it's a very conscious decision to have to go and get 40 for, you know, 20.
Speaker A:
Yeah, I just use. I encourage people to use paper bags from the grocery store if that is an issue or if people just don't know, don't want to go out and find them or seek them out.
Speaker J:
Like, it's like paper bag things that are wet.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker A:
And then I tell people. Then I tell people to do it. Put it in your freezer. I keep my compost in my freezer, and it's been a life changing practice versus how having it out on the counter. But I also. Then people say, well, my freezer's full or something.
Speaker B:
It's not perfect.
Speaker A:
It's not perfect.
Speaker B:
I don't know if this is, like, at my. I don't know if this is, like, the same thing you're talking about, but we have, like, a very little compost bin where we only use little bags and the bags are cheaper. Like, we have to take it out to the main trash can more often. But the bags probably don't cost as much like a whole big trash can.
Speaker A:
Right.
Speaker F:
Yeah, we.
Speaker J:
I have it in my main, as my main kitchen garbage, and so it gets full quick with, you know, kleenexes and, you know, having no, as well, but, yeah, so, yeah, I think we tried with paper bags initially, and it was like, you know, it gets seepy.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker J:
Yeah, it's nasty. So, you know, that could contribute to.
Speaker F:
Some negative feelings about it, more education.
Speaker H:
About how to use it.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker H:
Because even when my parents come visit who have been to my house many times, and we've composted for, like, ten years in those ways, and they're still like, I don't know what to do with this.
Speaker C:
Yeah, I definitely had to do try and air, and I found a metal trash bin that had a metal lid to it, and that was really, that's what I used.
Speaker D:
I got it at target, and it's just, you know, you know, it's just, it's metal. And I just keep it on my kitchen counter. And it's very convenient because I just put all my organics as I'm cooking into it. And I also posted that on nextdoor. Like, this is really not that difficult how you can set it up, you know? You know, it's like $15 to buy the little canister. And I did talk to my neighbor, and he, he is doing it, and he said, I really didn't like it at first. He goes, but now it's just a habit. And so a lot of this sustainability is really our habit.
Speaker A:
Definitely. Yeah.
Speaker F:
Change is hard, and you can always barrier. And I think especially with this, the sensitivity is because it wasn't a choice and it was money. As little as where I'm like, oh, my God, like, die mad. I'll give you the $3 a month. Like, why? Like, guys, this is, like, you can either have the choice to do the right thing, or you can have the choice to, like, continue to do the wrong, like, wrong thing or harmful thing. And your tax for that is paying the, you know, however much a month. Like, is how I think about it. But there. Not everyone has that mentality, and it is asking, like, there's the expectation of, you don't have a choice. You're paying more. You do need to do something. You need to learn something different to change your habits. And that is, like. That's asking a lot.
Speaker A:
But I don't think a lot of.
Speaker D:
People understand that when they put their organics in the regular, it turns into methane. And how that is even worse.
Speaker A:
They don't.
Speaker D:
They don't know that there's such a lack of awareness in education that methane is worse than even greenhouse emissions.
Speaker F:
Yeah.
Speaker D:
You know, and that's why food waste is huge, a huge issue, and we have, you know, 40% of our food is wasted.
Speaker A:
So more education is the recurring theme, I suppose. More.
Speaker H:
It's, like, on the other side, because sometimes you're like, oh, let's have a more walkable neighborhood or, like, more public transit.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker H:
Lived in that world or, like, experienced that. You have no idea what it's like. And so the fear of change is more as the larger thing.
Speaker A:
Yeah. Which.
Speaker H:
That'd be great if, like, there was a video of, like, what a commute would look like in a truly walkable city, like, in Amsterdam or something like that. Versus sitting in traffic to get to downtown or.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker E:
And they could be as far as, like, a two minute animated video.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker E:
Just to show, like, what you're saying, Carol, what Carol was saying. You know, there are a lot of people don't realize when you put food into the garbage, it doesn't just compost, it turns into methane.
Speaker A:
So you can see this.
Speaker E:
This video.
Speaker B:
I'm sure there are videos about that. Yeah.
Speaker G:
And in Heffen county, it's probably gonna get burnt in the incinerator and not going to allow. But that's still.
Speaker A:
Not for much longer.
Speaker G:
But we don't want to say things to people that are inaccurate because then people who are looking for those outs will say, well, that was presented this way, but it's really this.
Speaker F:
I think.
Speaker J:
Having education that's specific to where we live.
Speaker D:
Exactly.
Speaker F:
Really targets the people that live.
Speaker J:
They're not just like, this is what's happening. Broad spectrum.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker J:
You know, like, this is happening in Robinson.
Speaker A:
This is how you can do what.
Speaker J:
You can do to help.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker B:
Yeah. That's actually fair because I was mentioning, like, pre existing videos. But, like, if we had someone make videos.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker J:
Like for here with.
Speaker B:
Because then I don't know. Then it's more specific and people can actually understand. Like, hey, here's how the organic composting works here. Not just you look up a video and it's like totally different thing and it doesn't make any sense and you have questions unanswered.
Speaker A:
I'm called out.
Speaker C:
Yeah, I know. With me, like, when we started doing the organics recycling, it was like I only had to take out the trash. Trash, like every other week. Now it's like I do that one week and then it's organics the other week because the regular trash doesn't accumulate as much. It's nothing gross. You know, I think, like that kind of thing, you know, could help sell it.
Speaker A:
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah.
Speaker I:
I ended up saving money because I got the smaller trash bin, which I would.
Speaker A:
Yeah. That's something that we try and plug as well. If people are a little bit upset about.
Speaker F:
Like, to show the, to show the, like the before and after, like that payoff, like, again, like, this is your return. I'm like, we're asking for a change. Yep. This is what your. It's $15 for that little bin and per thing. Like per little bag. It's this, like, we understand that however this big garbage bag, like, you're paying however many for, like, that big, strong, hefty bag. But guess what? Like, you don't need it to be that strong anymore because you're not putting the stinky, wet, really heavy stuff it and you're only taking it out this money. So really it's net. So it's not that much putting it in that because again, like, if you do look for the first time, you're like, oh, my God, these are so expensive. Okay, thanks, Robbins Dale. You're just really leaving me dry here. So if you like, you do have to illustrate that. But they would not ever know that without going through that and experiencing it. So again, that's just like another bare where it's a need to change and do something differently. I don't know how to do it. It's an economic barrier. All of these things that just continue to put up that, like, defensive wall where it's like, I'm not going to change, and then if it's not organics, it's going to be the next change that, like, there's.
Speaker E:
Some people are always going to hate it.
Speaker A:
Of course. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker E:
That's what that percentage. But, Megan, you really brought. That's should be our guiding thought. Our muse over us is it needs to be very specific to Robinsdale. Anything that we do needs to be specific.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker E:
With the education that we put out, the information sharing the knowledge needs to be very specific to Robinsdale.
Speaker G:
I was just going to ask, when it moved to people who were opting in to everybody, was there an increase in participants and.
Speaker A:
Yeah, I think we got, like, at least 400 new participants after that. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes, definitely. It's. It's grown. It's grown significantly. Yeah. Like January or so. Yeah, it's grown significantly, which is great.
Speaker F:
Is that something we could, you know, ask for case studies on, like. Or just.
Speaker A:
I think. Yeah, that's what I was. I was gonna say. It sounds like an organics case study would be useful, too.
Speaker B:
Yeah. In my opinion, I feel like the reason why we might only have 740 participants, I've. Because I, you know, I go to school in a totally different. I go to school. Work and home are in three different counties. So I've seen a lot of, like, information from the different places. And I feel like a lot of. I mean, at least for bigger cities, like, they get a lot more engagement because it's a lot more publicly known about that. Like, hey, yeah, you can do organics. Hey, yeah, this is like, a thing that's going on in our city. I feel like a lot more people are informed in bigger cities about that kind of stuff. And I usually, I go and interact with those other cities and their programming, and I didn't know that any of that was really, like, a thing that happened here. I thought it's just like, oh, this town is too small, so it doesn't really have any of that, like, informative stuff or programs like this. It's like, it's kind of a thing where I can do it in a bigger city, but not really here.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker I:
I think. Can I say one quick thing about this? I think of this system that it takes to operate organics also, and I don't think that's an efficient or sustainable system. Like, we're sending the concerns about trucks going through every alleyway and picking up garbage is not a perfect system. I think we're also, like, losing all that soil possibility that we could keep in town and use for community gardens or whatever. So I think there's also, like, what can we do to actually, like, address the. That system? Like, organics is great, but, like, let's not truck it to some other facility. We can, like, keep it. I don't know.
Speaker B:
I think the soil idea, that's.
Speaker A:
Yeah, I will just say right now, the sustainability committee will not be achieving things like that.
Speaker I:
Of course. Yeah.
Speaker A:
Okay. Another something that I'm gonna have to keep. You guys, we gotta stay down here. Um, but you guys can say, well.
Speaker F:
We can bring that to the city council meeting, right? And say, like, hey, um, we see you spending this money on this. No, like, this is very important. And we know that there are plenty of people fired up about this program as it is. And there were quite a lot of questions. I'm like, okay, so I'm paying for that. If I'm not using it, I'm paying for it. Like, great. If I using and paying for it. However, even if I am engaged and I'm putting. I'm doing the work. I'm putting my stuff in for it every week. My trash isn't stinky. When better for the earth. When I do a lot of gardening, I'd like to get a little something out of that. For me paying for it and me doing that extra work, I'm not getting anything out of it. It would be nice to say, like, hey, city. Like, yeah. Can you, as a long term goal, say, well, we know that our, we've got issues with who is handling our waste management in general. We would like you to take this in consideration and look to make this a little bit more circular and bring this back. So, yeah, whether it's processed somewhere, but, like, we need to have that returned to us for in some way. There's, like, all of that unused land right at the community garden right there where we could have ten times as many plots.
Speaker C:
It's.
Speaker F:
It's in ward two.
Speaker A:
Unlike drive between beard and challenge, there's two. There's one off of Lake Drive and there's another one in downtown on West Broadway. Yeah. So I know a compost giveaway sort of event has definitely been discussed as an idea among staff.
Speaker B:
Yeah. Another type of thing would be just, like, giving resources on how you can take. You know, when people are thinking about organics, they have this, like, they already know, like, giving resources on how to use that for your garden as like, for a, you know, supplement until we can bring it to, like, a city level type of thing. Just like, hey, if you want to use your compost to it, does all this, like, all this good stuff, stuff for your garden, if you want to use it, here's how you do that. And maybe someday we'll have a thing with the city for it.
Speaker A:
If, like, planning an event like that is something that the committee wants to attempt, then that's definitely it.
Speaker B:
I'm so daring because I.
Speaker A:
That's, like, tangible outcome that we could spend our efforts on. A lot of great conversation on organics, and it's good helpful for me to know that, just to hear these comments and questions again, since organics was a huge focus in the beginning of the year, but it's kind of settled down a bit, so it's just helpful to hear these. Hear these things again.
Speaker D:
Restaurants. Do we address restaurants at all? Because there's a lot of enormous food ways.
Speaker A:
Yeah. So before we had our Green Corps member, Noah, we had a Green Corps member, 2022 to 2023, whose focus was waste and organics and recycling. And she did some outreach with restaurants with the help of Minnesota wastewise, which is an organization out of the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce. So they assist with outreach directly to residents or not residents restaurants. But, and the county has some grants available, too, for businesses and restaurants to use to kind of enhance their organics and recycling management. But quite frankly, I have not done much work directly with restaurants. There's definitely a very good opportunity.
Speaker J:
Very cool, if, you know, everybody on main drag was involved in that.
Speaker A:
Yeah, I know she did some, when Abby was with us or serving with us, she did some outreach like that. And it was, if I remember correctly, it was a mixed bag of whether or not restaurants were actually interested. But, yeah, that's definitely a good idea, too, for us to keep in mind as a focus or a project of sorts. Okay, we're getting down to the last few slides, so I just wanted to highlight the Greenstep Cities program, which the city is involved in. We track metrics every year, and so I just listed kind of some highlights of our green step reporting for 2023. We are part of the Charging Smart program, which is a federally funded program from the Department of Energy, which is, again, another voluntary program that helps us to identify actions related to electric vehicles and electric vehicle readiness. So that's just kind of a great checklist of sorts. Honestly, for me, when thinking about policies and things like that. That will make electric vehicle infrastructure more readily available to our residents and our businesses. And we also have a staff sustainability committee that meets every month. So we've got maybe the number of members kind of fluctuates, but we have representation from admin department, public works, engineering, community development, recreation. It's really good representation among staff. So that is a productive committee, as well. And I'm sure there will be plenty of crossover and opportunity for the staff committee and the residential committee to work together on some things. And then, lastly, I just wanted to call out the efforts of other staff. So we've talked a little bit about native plants and lawns and such. Tonight. Our city forester natural resources specialist does a ton of work with, you know, maintaining the urban forests in Robbinsdale and managing Emerald ash borerhood, encouraging more tree plantings throughout the community with our tree sales. Yeah, just our city forester is awesome. And if you have any questions or concerns or want to, you know, point out an area of town that you think might need his attention, he is very willing to talk to, like, meet.
Speaker B:
With him and talk to him. He seems, like, super educated on that kind of stuff, and as someone who is more in that natural and water resources area of expertise.
Speaker A:
Yeah, yeah. Safon is great. You could reach out to him at any time.
Speaker B:
I probably will.
Speaker A:
Yeah. We also have a water resources specialist who focuses on the protection of our lakes in Robbinsdale. I know that those are kind of a gem of Robinsdale, a reason that people love living here.
Speaker B:
So, are there other lakes other than just crystal?
Speaker A:
Yes, there's Lor twin Lake and Ryan Lake. Thank you.
Speaker B:
Because I just kind of stay in, like, this, like, my general area. I don't go, like, all around Robbinsdale often, so I don't know, like, the names of the other lakes.
Speaker A:
Yep, there's three.
Speaker B:
Cool.
Speaker A:
So, Jenna is our water resource specialist. She, you know, oversees the construction sites and such, making sure that they're not actively contaminating our streets that will then eventually end up in our lakes. The new water treatment plant has been a really a huge kind of groundbreaking treatment plant because it softens the water at the treatment plant, so residents don't need a water softener. It's reducing the. The water treatment plant is right next to Lee park.
Speaker B:
Okay.
Speaker A:
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker B:
Okay. I know what you're talking about.
Speaker A:
And so, yeah, that's just another thing that I think is worth calling out of. We talked a little bit about the community garden. There's two different community gardens in the city, both with 20 plots, we've got some solar and wind powered lights in our parks. We're working on a parks master plan, which will include some kind of sustainability focused measures. So that is kind of the. Just a high level look at some of the other things that are going on, you know, outside of my daily focuses. Yeah.
Speaker F:
The smart salting education is something very impactful that I think not a lot of people understand how extremely damaging that is. Much like, food waste back from my grass and my dog's feet, and it's like, oh, that's a. Yeah, that's an inconvenience. Yeah, it's very, very much a bigger problem. Yeah, that would be something great. Just like, it's already fall, so people will be salty within the next couple months.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
Just like with our first. I don't know, even something like, in the. I don't know, city newsletters, if we'll have a spot for. If we look at it from, like, an editorial or, like, quarterly, monthly approach of, like, what is very relevant now.
Speaker A:
Yeah, I know that our. The permitting process, I'm not sure exactly what it's called, but our water resources specialist has to meet a certain, like, minimum level of outreach and engagement when it comes to that kind of thing. So.
Speaker F:
There'S a meet and greet.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
Yeah. She was the one there, right?
Speaker A:
Mm hmm. She had a. Yeah, she had a booth at the end of the street.
Speaker F:
Yeah.
Speaker A:
So I love my ice cream, and.
Speaker D:
I don't see people having, though.
Speaker B:
I don't know.
Speaker E:
I feel like I'm the only one.
Speaker F:
Out there scraping the ice, the big metal.
Speaker C:
Yeah. People use way more salt than they need, and I switched to using. I think it's chicken grit or something I get from Flea farm. So that it's interesting. Not even.
Speaker A:
Yeah. So we do it, like, a certain extent. To a certain extent, have smart salting information in our newsletters on social media and the bird town brief. But I think there's just this, as we've discussed throughout the night, there's this greater challenge of, like, how much. How much is the right amount of education, and how do we get that information out, you know, beyond our normal channels of social media, the newsletter that gets mailed out to residents, the bird town brieftain, that goes out every single week, the city website. So I think, like, finding creative ways beyond those, you know, easy things that we do every single week as a city, finding creative ways to engage and conduct outreach is going to be really impactful, and I think something that this committee could be really good for.
Speaker B:
Remember, that you were at the farmers market a lot, Nick.
Speaker I:
Yeah, the RCC group was. Yeah.
Speaker A:
The city also has a booth at the farmer's market every, almost every week. But the farmer's market does not have very many attendees for the city to talk to. But that is a conversation. We can have a different night, maybe not at a committee meeting.
Speaker F:
So much info I get from them just as a way to. Because a lot of residents are in new Hope and Crystal and Minneapolis and elsewhere.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
And parents, young kids, like, pretty engaged. So maybe just, I don't know, certain things that are relevant. We could try to see if.
Speaker A:
I.
Speaker F:
Don'T know, the school district would let us.
Speaker A:
Yeah. Mm hmm. I would love to get more engaged with the schools and the school district.
Speaker B:
Right there.
Speaker A:
In my experience, it's been really. It's been really hard to get in contact with someone at the school district.
Speaker F:
We'll call. See right there. Like, that's where he goes. We're all up in there. And, like, you and RM's.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
I know people at the girls culture. We've got girls.
Speaker A:
Okay, perfect.
Speaker F:
We'll get all of them in here.
Speaker A:
Great. I think the school.
Speaker F:
Like, professional.
Speaker E:
Sure.
Speaker F:
Like high school. Are very engaged. Love to feel, I think, useful. A lot of them need to do service hours. This is something that will look great on, like, college application.
Speaker H:
Every kid's a content creator.
Speaker F:
Like, no, seriously. Like, everyone wants to get there. All content creators, but, like, AV groups. Do they still have AV clubs at high schools? I hope so.
Speaker B:
AV audio visual.
Speaker F:
Audio visual. Like, they produced, I don't know, in.
Speaker H:
High school, used to be back when you'd have to go, like, borrow a camera to make a video.
Speaker F:
Yeah, yeah. But just like, how, like, engaging the youth within our city because they. I mean, they're the ones inheriting a lot of.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
Not to be doom and gloom, but I am, like, with Penelope, I'm like, I'm sorry. Like, yeah, we can recycle, but it's engaging them because they are the ones.
Speaker E:
That need, and they get it, too. They get it so much more.
Speaker F:
Yeah, we're talking about microplastics. We're not just like, oh, yeah. Reduce, reuse, recycle.
Speaker A:
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker J:
The just throw their chick fil a.
Speaker A:
Bags onto the curb.
Speaker F:
So we need some kind of an education. Was that bird town? Was it?
Speaker A:
No, that was.
Speaker J:
No, what I. What I do is I just dump.
Speaker A:
It right back into their yard. On the other side, a little pumpkin. Getting in touch with the school district is definitely a goal of mine. And, like, let's go. Yeah.
Speaker B:
So get in touch with the DNR?
Speaker A:
I have. We could get in touch with the DNR.
Speaker B:
I can get in touch with the DNR. I have a bunch of their emails.
Speaker A:
Okay. Our water resources specialist works pretty closely with the DNR.
Speaker E:
Of course.
Speaker A:
Jenna. Yeah, I would say we're pretty in tune with the different state departments. Any other comments or questions about city programs?
Speaker F:
The green card? So we had Abby and Noah.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
Is that a city? Is that a grant or a funded? Like, will we have that every year, that position?
Speaker A:
So you have to apply to be a host site to host a green corps member. So it's entirely voluntary, optional. We just did not apply to host again this program year. It's definitely something that we could do again in the future, though.
Speaker B:
That seemed like something, like, super helpful in the past. I would say for the 2025 26 season, that would probably be a helpful thing to do again, because it seems like a lot of the major impacts we've had have been either, like, created or furthered by the green corps members.
Speaker A:
Yeah, it's been immensely helpful to have green corps members. It's just great to have another person.
Speaker F:
To work with, somebody help implement.
Speaker A:
Yeah, that's a really good idea for these, like, actionable items for the committee. I think we could. And that timing would work out well, too, because the application to be a host site opens, like, in the early, early 2025. And then that member would start with us in September of next year if we were selected.
Speaker B:
So I want to do green core at some point when I'm not in college.
Speaker A:
That's an awesome program. Okay. If there's no other comments or questions about programs, we can move on. In any normal meeting, we would have old business to discuss. Now we don't have any because this is our first meeting, but so next we'll just move on to information, aka updates. So I'll just remind folks that we meet monthly on the third Wednesday of the month at 06:00 p.m. here at city hall. So our next meeting will be October 16. And I am hopeful that our next meeting, we can compile everyone's top three. And by that I mean come to the meeting with your top three concerns, ideas, goals, hopes, needs, wants. Interpret it as you wish, but come prepared to talk about what it is. The top three things that you want to see this committee address or prioritize. And I think that if we compile all of those together, we can sort of see where kind of the main heavy hitters are and prioritize from there. And also, I'm just genuinely curious what it is that you all care about the most. And then also, just a note that the committee works in an advisory capacity to the city council. So the committee itself is not going to be doing any implementing or creation of policy, but we can recommend to the council that they consider a policy or something like that. So just keep that in mind. Everyone has so many great ideas, and it's exciting to talk about all the potential, but I just want to make sure that we're being realistic, too, with what we can accomplish, quite honestly, as a commission or a committee that meets once a month in an advisory capacity. And then also, the goal will be to provide an update to the council after six months of the committee's operation. So in about six months, we will update the city council on how things are going, what we've either accomplished or hope to accomplish, perhaps provide some recommendations if we have them at that point. But the six month update can also happen however we see fit. So that could be the committee presenting at a city council meeting. It could be just me doing that. It could be a more like, open discussion at a city council work session, something like that. So it's up to us to kind of decide what we want to do for that update. So just keep that in mind as we progress here and start to meet.
Speaker I:
Can I ask something?
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker I:
What's the difference between a committee and commission in that sense? So this was supposed to eventually lead to a commission. I know that could change, but.
Speaker A:
Yeah. And that could kind of. The goal, ultimately, is for this to be a formal commission. So a commission is written into the city code, and we'll, like, more explicitly state what we can and cannot do and who can be a member or, like, who. The makeup of the committee. And so for it to be written into code, it requires the council review and a reading and then a second reading. And there's a lot. It's a more formal process, and it's.
Speaker I:
More directive towards the council instead of advising. Right. Or is it kind of still advising?
Speaker A:
Kind of still advising, yeah. Any questions on that?
Speaker C:
So one thing that I wonder is, after the new council is seated, yes. It would be probably good to check in with them and see what their appetite is. This kind of thing.
Speaker A:
Yeah. Thank you for bringing that up. I was gonna. Didn't scroll down to that part of my notes. We will have three new council members, including a new mayor in 2025. So we'll see how things like sustainability and climate work are received by the new council. But that will line up well with this, like, six month kind of timeline of providing an update because six months from now will be about March. And in March, I think that new council will be a little bit more settled and. And they'll be past the big, you know, all the kind of songs and dances that they have to do in the beginning of a new term and the beginning of a new year. So it'll really be the perfect time for us to sit down with the new council and.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker A:
Gauge their interests. Like you said, I. So thank you for bringing that up. And don't forget to vote on November 5 or earlier. You can vote early at city hall starting this Friday.
Speaker B:
I hate to disappoint, but I don't turn 18 until next March.
Speaker A:
It's okay.
Speaker B:
It's very unfortunate.
Speaker G:
I was just going to say, but even with the new council, I would imagine there will be some appetite because your position is not transient, right?
Speaker A:
Yeah, this won't be. Yeah.
Speaker B:
Yes.
Speaker G:
I guess I'm trying to reassure.
Speaker A:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess I didn't. I didn't mean to, like, strike fear, but it'll just be. It'll just be, though. They'll have different. Different priorities. So I'm not worried about it at all, based on what I know about the people who are running.
Speaker G:
But this would still be on the horizon.
Speaker A:
Yes. Yep, yep, yep. We don't have anything to worry about, at least for now. And we can go around and give quick roundtable updates just because I think that's a good practice that we'll get into at the future meeting. So we'll go this way again. And it's okay if you don't have any, we'll just. Yeah.
Speaker B:
What are we updating on?
Speaker A:
Whatever you want. If you have any updates. If you don't, that's okay. Too.
Speaker C:
Happy to be here.
Speaker A:

I'm excited about this committee.
Speaker A:
Awesome. Me too.
Speaker D:
Yeah, that sounds good.
Speaker G:
But I don't have an update, so.
Speaker H:
Yeah, excited.
Speaker F:
So many ideas.
Speaker I:
I'm excited as well. There's also an RCC group that I organize that's outside of this, that's climate oriented. It's called Robinson collective.
Speaker B:

Speaker I:
Yeah, we're just online meeting you.
Speaker A:
Fair enough.
Speaker J:
It's nice to see all of the.
Speaker A:
Passion in the room. People are kind of fired up, you.
Speaker J:

Speaker F:
That people are willing to show up and try to, I don't know, try.
Speaker A:
To make change happen. Yeah.
Speaker J:
Even on a lower level.
Speaker B:
This is a very unrelated update, but just before the 16th, it's actually like the weekend before I'm driving myself to Illinois to spend like $2,000 on a lizard.
Speaker A:
Oh, wow.
Speaker B:
They are the largest live in geckos. They're called Lycianus geckos. They are very green. And so the 16th next meeting, I will have a very big gecko to show you all.
Speaker A:
Cool.
Speaker F:
Can you bring it here?
Speaker B:
Can I?
Speaker A:
Oh, no.
Speaker F:
I don't know.
Speaker B:
Am I allowed to bring a lizard to city?
Speaker A:
I actually don't know.
Speaker B:
You should actually check because if I am allowed to, I actually will. I will bring the lizards.
Speaker A:
Lizard, question mark. Lizard.
Speaker F:
Who ate the.
Speaker A:
Okay, meeting adjourned. Yeah.
Speaker B:
Big old 40 gallon tank on its side.
Speaker A:
I gave a million updates. I don't need to give another one. Thank you all for coming. I appreciate you all. Email me anytime. You have my email?
Speaker B:
Do you have retcon?
Speaker D:
No, I don't.
Speaker A:
Email me. Oh, okay.
Speaker C:
Like next month or the month after, whatever.
Speaker B:
We also have like everything in high school. Yeah, I can go bother my animal signs teacher about that because I'm in the college animal science course. But yeah, I have like a ridiculous amount of pets already. Yeah, as I mentioned, I said like 50 earlier. I was not exaggerating. I'm dead serious. If you want the list, I can give you the list.
Speaker F:
I mean, maybe I'll just pay my girl scout trooper for a field trip.
Speaker B:
I guess if you want to bring your girl scouts to my room. That is full of a bunch of dead bugs on the wall.
Speaker A:
Oh, my God.
Speaker F:
Now my childhood collects she's dead things. We were doing our park cleanup. Well, it was before we sandboard. Yes. She found a full. It's got like a skull and it's like a full vertebrae. We haven't identified it yet.
