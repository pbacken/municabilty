Speaker A:
Section to order.
Speaker B:
If we could get a roll call, please. Council member Parisian.
Speaker C:
Here.
Speaker A:
Council member Murphy.
Speaker D:
Present.
Speaker B:
Council member one again. Here, here.
Speaker A:
All right, and then before we get into the bulk of the agenda here, I just want to take a moment to recognize future council member Jason Greenberg. And welcome to the meeting. And also, maybe we can just go around the table and reintroduce everybody since we have a new face and. Yeah, so let's do that. So why don't you start, Jason?
Speaker E:
Yeah, so I'm Jason Greenberg, just won the special election. So I think I get signed in on Friday or get not sworn in, but whatever happens on Friday, something gets. I don't know. Tim, tell me what happened.
Speaker B:
Yep. So Friday afternoon, council will formally recognize the results of the election. Swearing in will happen Tuesday. At the start of the meeting, you will be seated and will be a voting member on Tuesday.
Speaker E:
There you go. That's what I wanted to say.
Speaker C:
Okay, I'm lending with this one. Congratulations, Jason. I'm Mia Parisian, representing ward three on city council.
Speaker E:
I'm Rachel Lean, I'm the communications coordinator.
Speaker C:
I'm Heather Rand, community development director.
Speaker E:
Hi.
Speaker C:
Hello.
Speaker F:
I'm Bill Blahnigan, the mayor, finance director.
Speaker B:
Tim Sandyk, city manager.
Speaker G:
Richard McCoy, public works director, city engineer.
Speaker D:
All right.
Speaker A:
And I'm Aaron Wagner, ward four representative. Thank you for that. Mighty slightly redundant, but that's okay. So let's go into the first item, which is the budget discussion.
Speaker B:
Yeah. Mayor pro tem, I will jump right in. I'll give a little bit of background, walk through some high level items. You've got the finance director here for questions, but this is our first swing formally. Per the city charter, city manager is required to present some level of a budget for your consideration. As a reminder, the council is required to approve a preliminary not to exceed levy by the end of September. This is then sent to our neighboring jurisdictions in the state. This is a preliminary, and I say not to exceed. In that in the following months, we're able to reduce the percentage of the levy or the levy in total, I should say, but want to note that the numbers that are approved at that September meeting, that's what goes on in your tax statements. You receive something in the mail from the county, what your proposed number is, that's what shows up. Council formally adopt a budget for 2025 in December. We're hoping to do that at the first meeting. We've talked about the budget calendar a little bit this spring. We made some alterations to both do approval of the budget and the ten year CIP at that first meeting in December just to help with logistics year and start off January in a hit the ground running kind of fashion. So we've shared a little bit about this. Folks have been through this from once or twice up to this will be the 44th budget for at least one person in the road. So to varying degrees, and I just share that in, please, no questions are bad questions. Remind me of something. What does this mean? I encourage that we as staff sit and stare at this stuff all day, so we've got an unfair advantage. So if anything we go across sounds french, please jump in. Department heads met with their, as we traditionally do, met with their teams throughout the spring and the summer. And then every department had the finance director meet with the city manager to go through their funds line by line. That's just to refine, make sure we're talking about the same thing. And again, when I say line by line, a lot of those funds are operational, so bulk of that's personnel. But, you know, the day to day stuff that makes the city function. As I noted, the CIP is something we'll get to later in the year. That approval will happen again in December but not included in the discussion tonight. I will share the story that I often tell folks that I've had councils sort of on a spectrum and how they want to set the budget. I've been part of cities where the mayor and council say, x percent is what we want. You staff don't figure it out. We present it in September and it's approved as long as we meet that threshold. I've had other councils on the other end of that spectrum that literally go through fun by fun line, and it's a tedious process. Last year, I think we kind of found a happy medium and we're sort of bringing back a similar style here today. So again, I would say that if there are things either tonight or if you're looking for materials between now and when we get into September, please let us know. I will start at the end. What we have put in front of you reflects a 12% increase to the general fund levy that includes a deficit of 373,000 in change. And if it sounds like that's a big jump, it is, because compared to last year, we got a 6% increase. Now, again, the preliminary doesn't need to be set until next month, so we've got a lot of time to refine that. You, as a counselor for tonight, is to tell us where that number is, including some things that you support, some things that you're not excited about one of the big outside influences. I want to call out fiscal disparities. For those not familiar. When we see across the metro growth in commercial, industrial and public utility land, that growth, I think it's 40%. 40% of that growth is measured essentially thrown in a pot and then redistributed by way of population and property value. The kind of general thinking is that here in Robbinsdale, you know, we don't have a lot of room to grow. Commercial, industrial, no room to grow at all. It's redevelopment. And, for example, our friends to the west, crystal, a little bit new hope, more, Plymouth, even more. They've got opportunity to grow, and especially those commercial and industrial settings, they're reliant on Robbinsdale residents as both workers, consumers of those goods, all those things. It's a philosophical thing to sort of spread that growth out. But fiscal disparities, unfortunately, we saw a decrease of 895,500.
Speaker F:
Change.
Speaker B:
That's a big number. Why was that growth was so limited where we'll be having, what, a year lagde. But that growth was limited compared to the year prior.
Speaker F:
I don't understand that, but I'll work to figure that out.
Speaker B:
So, yeah, I mean, if you think metro wide, all seven counties, that total, I don't know what the total percentage would be, but if you go back two years, which would be 21 and 22, we saw people coming out of COVID just getting after it. And in part, some of that, we caught up to that, getting after having.
Speaker F:
Their taxes reduced on their buildings.
Speaker B:
When I say getting after, I mean making increase in commercial and industrial property. So new build, reconstruction, so reinvestment, specifically in those two areas, for a few reasons, we saw a decrease in 2023, which is now reflected. Some of that has to do with borrowing rates. So there's less investment in commercial and industrial because of that boom, generally. I mean, we have a growth rate projection that's flat, you can say over 20 years. Here's your flat average. You're going to have some of these where we're in an ebb and flow. We're in the negative direction right now.
Speaker F:
So everybody that gets fiscal disparities is to one extent or another experiencing this kind of a decrease.
Speaker B:
That's correct. Similar in kind of the outside influence frame we saw. I considered essentially even year to year with local government aid, or LGA, as we often refer to again. Local government aid is a formula that the state puts together. There's an algorithm where we primarily benefit by age of housing stock. There's a number of things that go into it. We are a beneficiary of it. We do very well for the size of our city, but didn't see any real growth from year to year. A lot of that has to do. Again, similarly, values, residential values, didn't see the increases that we saw in 21, 22. Things are still high, but didn't see a decrease. But year to year, I consider pretty even some things we want to call out at. Current 2024 has an estimated surplus of over $800,000. I want to note the 2024 budget includes a deficit of 240,785. That said, you know, I get a little bit nervous in the amount of some of the outstanding things that we're uncertain of, including overtime for like public works and plowing. We see a lot of this with PD. You're welcome to have a seat if you like. So while we're projecting that at this point, that doesn't mean we'll be at that same number at the end of the year. And all that said, a surplus can be absorbed for the 2025 levy. We'll have a better understanding when we get into that November timeframe. So again, an opportunity when we set that prelim, if we do want to do any kind of reduction, that may be an opportunity to do that. Yep.
Speaker D:
For example, the GIS technician. We budgeted for that last year.
Speaker F:
Right.
Speaker B:
You didn't hire.
Speaker H:
There was a venture positioning in January.
Speaker D:
Ticker musician.
Speaker H:
This is a new. Currently we are dealing with lodges for 4 hours and a month. But for the project that's going on live in 2025, Mister McCoy said he will need full time.
Speaker B:
Okay.
Speaker D:
So. Okay, my question is, of the 800,000 surpluses, any of that related to positions that were budgeted? If we're not filled.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker H:
Police.
Speaker B:
Okay. Yeah.
Speaker G:
With PD.
Speaker B:
It's not even a one one.
Speaker D:
I'm sorry, you're just saying. Another engineer.
Speaker B:
Oh yeah, engineering. You've been working with Philip for some months. Yeah. PD. Again, the caveat there is it's not a one for one cost savings. And then we pay a lot of overtime, traditional hours. So it's not necessarily per position. But yeah, those would be the bulk.
Speaker D:
So it just be my club. The surplus is.
Speaker B:
Going to be budgeted.
Speaker D:
For again, I suspect this year to those positions.
Speaker B:
There is no proposal to reduce positions. We do have a few on the top of the second page here, your memo. Thank you. There are a few positions we're proposing to add. The GIS technician under engineering facilities, maintenance person under parks, and some administrative health for public safety. So the GIS position has noted. You know, as we continue to take additional work on. There was a time that our partnership will just work, but we far exceed those hours. So be able to have that level of in house will help Richard and his team, not just for next year, but for years to come. Facility maintenance, that's just a way recognition of growth that we continue to add to what we have by way of facilities, whether it's parts, the water treatment plant. We've got more to do to help keep our buildings. So this was an asset parts actually put in last year and we did not have. So we're bringing back for consideration the administrative assistant in public safety. The proposal is to be a 50 50 split between the fire and the police. As you heard in your presentation from the fire chief earlier this spring, the asks continue to increase. We've got reporting we're required to do. That's new. We've got technology we're getting to deal with that hasn't been required in the past. And then same thing with PD that we're just at the gills with what our current admin team can handle. We didn't have enough to justify just the one full time for fire. Splitting between the two will easily fill up a position. So those are the three positions that we've proposed.
Speaker F:
So does that add three full time equivalents?
Speaker B:
Yes.
Speaker F:
Did we add three positions last year?
Speaker B:
Last year was community development, recreation, added full time. And the sustainability coordinator.
Speaker F:
And I thought maybe we had a half time something in engineering.
Speaker G:
Maybe last year at an engineering intern for the song.
Speaker F:
Okay. And so now at this time this year, we've got the police that are hired. So what do we have authorized as full time employees now? And what do we actually have?
Speaker B:
High eighties. 788. And I believe we're at 79.
Speaker F:
Okay. You can get there for 70.
Speaker B:
I take that back. 77. I think we're down ten or eleven right now. Okay.
Speaker E:
Tim, can I ask a question?
Speaker B:
I should stop calling. This is mere protein.
Speaker E:
Aaron, can I ask a question, please?
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker E:
So is the 12% increase your best estimate of where we're gonna land? Or is that like the minimum of what it has to be? Or like, what's the 12% mean?
Speaker B:
So 12% means to incorporate all things that we've got listed here. And this includes at least a portion of salary investments. The common class value is important to council, something we're in the process of wrapping up right now. So. Bubba, increase is related just to personnel. If we leave tonight with direction that council wants to see percent at x. We'll come back with a revised version. So the 12% includes everything that you got here, the last couple of things that are on here. In 2025, no significant capital requests were made. It should be noted that internal service funds are near balance. Central services increased about 2%, garage decreased 2.7%, risk management and some of those things, again, outside of our control, to include recommendation by LMCIT. And we're seeing right now it's projected at a 9% increase for health insurance. Just kind of. Some of those external forces are also included in this. The last thing I have on here is the debt service portion of the levees, estimated at 1.195 and change. This is an increase from 427 and change from 2024 related to the bond that was issued in 2023. So that's ILO presentation where we're at with it. We're looking to take the temperature again. We've got a little bit of time to get a couple meetings to get dialed in, but looking for initial feedback from council. My goal would be to walk away from this council. Some level of things that you're interested in, you're not interested in, and if we want to start talking in terms of percentage, that might be helpful, too. So we just want to go back and start to dial in. Council member Murphy, thanks. I'll just comment.
Speaker D:
You know, I remember last year when we were in conversation that would warn against treating fiscal disparities in LGA as part of our budget because it fluctuates so much. And this is a perfect example. We've had it happen before, more so with LGA. This is the biggest drop I've seen with fiscal disparities because it is the largest part of our budget, next to taxes, is government funding for these two items. So now it puts us in a tough position, because now we are looking at double, per the request for staff, double what we did last year. Last year, 6%. This year is now 20. So again, it's the staffing that is to be very expensive, and it's a big part of our largest part of the budget. That being said, 12%. This scares me a lot. There's no doubt a moment, because everybody's worrisome. So just my initial is I'd like.
Speaker B:
To see you much closer to what.
Speaker D:
We did last year and just don't.
Speaker B:
Know what that looks like.
Speaker D:
So I know you provided options. This one, Jason, this form here is kind of the highlighted one, is what staffing staff is proposed and to get various options and how it affects residents on an average household what it might need for an increase each year or next year. Yeah, I guess I would just like more information. If we're looking at, let's just say, for example, a six or 8% increase, what staff thinks that would be a reduction of services staff, especially since you don't have any capital requests in this budget. That means it comes down a lot to staffing.
Speaker B:
And so what you're seeing here tonight, the operational levy is very much personnel. If what you're suggesting, if council were to give the direction of. We'd like to see 8%. Dia and I and the other department heads, Richard, certainly would go back, brainstorm either by way of additional asks, current vacancies, and then I think we would start to consider looking at some deficit. We would increase that budget deficit. We can project with some level of certainty we'll have turnover. That's where a lot of personnel cost savings comes from. Positions just sit vacant and we absorb a little of that. Now, long term employees that go out and get their vacation paid or some of these things, we budget for those balances as a liability, but there's an additional cost with that, with training and bringing new people on. So it's not always a one for one. But to your question, what we would do, again, look at personnel, what do we need, what do we don't based on that, that percentage number, I mean.
Speaker D:
Because we don't have opportunities to increase revenue, really, like the liquor store. We can't, you know, fund or, you know, change our budget. So generally speaking, it's cutting our costs, if you will. And that's the problem, is you don't like to eliminate positions like. No wants to do that. So we always have to be mindful when we add them, the long term implications. So those are my thoughts initially.
Speaker F:
So I'm thinking I'd rather go down to 10%. I'd rather go two. I would like to go more if we can. You know, I'm looking at this. We projected a budget deficit last year of $240,000. Are policing fires? Like, I don't know, the police alone are maybe 54% of the budget. Is that all right? Is that the exact number?
Speaker H:
It's more than 50% sometimes.
Speaker F:
I'd like to get that, but let's say it's about 54%. We're seven or eight officers short habitually. We save all those salaries. We pay overtime, as Tim indicated. We projected last year that we would have a $240,785 deficit. And yet we're projecting now that we're going to have a 900,890. 5571. Oops. That's the. No, that's. We would have a surplus of over $800,000. So that's like. It seems like we're $1,040,785 better than what we thought we'd be at the budget time last year, albeit snowstorms can happen. We're not to the end of the year yet. Anyway, I feel comfortable in using that 800,000 extra that we have. We always thought we'd have a $240,000 deficit this year. I feel comfortable in using a big portion of that to decrease our 12% to 10%, maybe even to eight. I mean, every. On this chart here, every 2% we go down adds $176,000, $176,018 to our deficit. So I feel comfortable having a bigger deficit and using part of our surplus this year to reduce taxes. And I don't see us coming to a full police force. I want to. I've tried to recruit people, but I don't see us getting there next year because of the market. We're going to increase our wages, which I think is good. But anyway.
Speaker H:
2023 because of special police department. In short of stuff, we had a saving of $1 million because of you over time is way cheaper than hiring. Full time benefit, but definitely cheaper. But we will save it. LGA, definitely. It's not stable. Like, we get kind of coevaline to last year, but less by 6000. But there is no guarantee in the future as well that LGA will stay the same. And when adding new position, you have to consider, like, even if 60,030% will go to benefit, so it will be costing 69,000 when you consider the benefit. This would be the challenge. Whenever you have a new position, the benefit to 30%.
Speaker F:
$60,000 equals $97,000. Okay.
Speaker H:
But for the cadet program we're expecting two of them will be joining the police next year. But still, like, police in general, short seven to eight officers most of the time.
Speaker A:
Yeah. So if we're short most of the time, how long? I mean, in my mind, there has to be, like a limit for, like, we can't just keep empty positions for ten years. It doesn't seem like a responsible thing to do. So I would, you know, if this is something that continues into the future, I would hope that we kind of revisit these empty positions regardless of department, to see if we can't find better ways to allocate the budget if they're not going to be filled. Because it seems like the case, but do we have, like, I know the city of Minneapolis has minimums of policing in their charter. Does Robbinsdale have anything like that?
Speaker B:
So I think to bring your two points together, there is an allowance for a total swarm. So that's what we budget for. So we're allowed to have up to that number. As I understand in Bill and Regan can speak to this. I think there was a time that the city did a reduction of a couple. The challenge with that is if in a world we do find seven officers to fill those positions, we don't budget for it, but we don't fill them. So trade offs. And to your point, not just PD, we have others. I think, you know, using one of the, well, using two of the proposed, the GIS person and the parts person, both engineering, public works area, you got no shortage of work. A lot of that gets farmed out. Some of it's just reflective of the nature of hiring right now. People are switching jobs more than ever, and we're looking for that, trying to catch that person in transition. So we've had some with some, the ones we had last year we've been able to fill up. But I think, you know, again, to the second part of your question, if there, if we as staff get direction to go with x percent, we'll reevaluate that places we do it. Just taking one off the books would be a huge cost savings. I see. Okay.
Speaker A:
That's helpful. I'm in agreement, I think, with, yeah, 12% is high, but, you know, remembering our discussions last year, I kind of see, like, if we're trying to be, you see, the utility of every option. To me, the utility of 12% is that it gets people talking. We can get maybe more community input and we still have the flexibility to lower it anyway. So I'm kind of, and I can be talked out of it, but I'm kind of leaning towards keeping it just to drive a sense of engagement. But, you know, I could be missing the mark, but because I agree with you, mayor, that it'd be good to get it down. Obviously, Regan was saying that too, but I think be a good way to drive public engagement, I think I would hope. But those are my thoughts. Customer Preeta.
Speaker C:
Thank you. I would add that I have a little bit of sticker shock with twelve. I think ten is a good target, like you were saying. And then to Regan's point earlier, if you know which of these levers we can pull, if it is personnel, I think given that some, if not all of these positions or proposals, including the proposed k nine unit. If these are new things that we haven't had before. When I think about, like, okay, well, how do we. How do we prioritize, like, which of these stays or which of these gets cut? My inclination is to. To come back to the priorities that the council has set. And maybe it's like some sort of, like, mapping activity where we're tying these new roles to the goals that we set to help kind of prioritize what is most important to this council and then what could be deprioritized in order to find some cost savings there.
Speaker D:
One quick question. In your experience, have either of you seen municipalities budget differently with fiscal disparities and levies and not levies, but LGA.
Speaker B:
LGA.
Speaker D:
Thank you. And budget a rolling, say, ten year average rather than to avoid, because usually it's a large amount, it's not a couple thousand dollars. So have you. I'm just curious if cities do that to avoid these kind of drastic ups and downs.
Speaker B:
I'm sure that some do. I've been in communities. The last community, I was saying $0 from Ella LGA. So that wasn't something we had. The fluctuation. The downside was, I think what you're suggesting is a straight line of percentage, year to year, some type of projection. That way we'll just take a ten.
Speaker D:
Year average of our LGA and use that to budget rather than, you know, or, for example, fiscal disparities. We budget for $500,000 each year rather than what we're actually getting.
Speaker B:
Just so.
Speaker D:
Eliminate these drastic ups and downs and. Or breaking it up in our budget and not relying on fiscal disparities. And LGBT for personnel. That's another discussion. But enough direction our input for now.
Speaker B:
Or do you want more specifics? Well, I can float out. Optics is a big thing. Sticker shot. That's a good word. And as silly as it may be, maybe what we as staff do is we come back with a version with 8% and 9.9%, both under ten. And you look that through in the September workshop. Is that eligible?
Speaker C:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
But you should always include information that the initial proposal was 12%. I mean, I want to give some credit to the council that was sticker shot. Create a perception that is actually reality, that we looked at this and tried to make it less onerous to the taxpayer.
Speaker B:
We can definitely do that. And I think to council member Peregrine's point, calling out some of where we're advocating directly tied to goals and priorities, we've sort of internally done that. But I am trying to keep the memo to a reasonable length.
Speaker C:
Sure.
Speaker B:
Do you have any clue to that kind of language? But we could definitely do that, I think, to help.
Speaker C:
Thank you.
Speaker A:
Yeah, Jason.
Speaker E:
So I guess one thing, just as far as it sounds like last year there were three new employees. This year we're asking for three new employees. I'm curious what that looks like over time. Is it always three or is it. Sometimes it's zero and sometimes it's five. And the last couple of years have been three.
Speaker B:
This would be back to back years. Of the addition of three. It was flat for a number of years. So I think to council member Murphy's comment, we're playing a bit of catch up. As we do more, we're required to do more. And a lot of this add to our stocks, to the facilities person, like I mentioned, it's to take care of what we're building. Some of the administrative tests there's going to be shifting. But at public safety, were required by the BCA to do certain reporting. They have certain technologies to have higher level standards, which is good, but it requires time and staff to do those things. So some of it's us, some of it's outside, to your question. Yeah. The last two years proposing three. That's not typical.
Speaker E:
Okay. And that actually dovetails right into the other thing, which is that, you know, you're listing out like, where we need to add people and where these funds would go. But so, like, to your point, we need to, you know, we need to update it and we need staffing to be able to update that. It. That I think you could. That's like a concrete reasoning on the. This is why it's going up. Whereas, like, did something change in our community that we feel we need a k nine unit that's different, or that, like, now is the time we need that because we envision like, what are the. Or, you know, for the GIS technician, it's like what is going on in Robbinsdale that warrants. Okay, here's why we need that change. Or like that addition.
Speaker B:
I think two good examples that we can bolster up in the next set of content. The canine unit is something that we've discussed internally for a couple of years, just hasn't risen to this level of conversation. One of the top goals and priorities of council is to have a fully staffed PD. And that's something that's of interest to PDE. Goal. It's included there. That's part of the goal. It's part of something that we as a group said we wanted to identify the GIS in my mind, and Richard can certainly speak to this, the functionality of the department is so reliant. It's not new technology, it's existing technology, but it's something that we all, say, dabble in. But similarly, that if we want to go after an engineering tech or that intern or trying to get people to come and see for a long time, we want to be able to have that as a part of our retention. So certainly functionality retention as well. If you want to expand that, I.
Speaker G:
Can expand on that. I mean, we have some GIS now, but we contract with lodges for 48 hours during the year. It costs us $50,000. You know, I could get somebody for 2080 hours for not much more than that.
Speaker E:
Right.
Speaker G:
The GIS function itself, our public works guys use it for locates. You know, they can get it downloaded on their tablets instead of having to run into the office every time, look up old cards about where the different bits of infrastructure are. So. And we're going to see, you know, if this project behind us here does go ahead, we're going to see locates constantly. It's going to be a battle just.
Speaker B:
To keep up with.
Speaker G:
We're getting a constant call on our information from other consultants. The park study wants to know where all of our utilities are. You know, the best way to do that is have it in a GIS file and say, well, here you go. With all of the reconstruction work we're doing, we have to constantly update the information in there because it changes with every project. We've got our guys out there, when they're doing the inspection, they're getting GPS readings on absolutely everything. But we've got to get that converted into the GIS program. So for it to be useful, we find without our workload, we just don't have the capacity to do that without someone that's dedicated to doing that role.
Speaker E:
Yeah, no, I mean, and that's the thing. I think there's a lot of reasons why we need these. Like, that makes a ton of sense. Just like being able to explain that to a constituent is important, I think.
Speaker H:
Let me talk about the canine program. Like it should add one new officer. But we didn't add in the budget. The new officer, since we know ahead, the police department would be short seven or eight officers. So only what we add in the budget was around $30,000 for operating supplies. So we didn't add for now because we know for sure we are short sell. So this about the k nine. It's not effective. Definitely in the future we have to look like he looks at the home value increase just 2% so it's going to slow down increase so you don't assume you will get much return so keep increasing this time slow down. We still positive gdp so I'm not sure about the recession now but it's possible in the future. So we have to be mindful. We don't have much resources other than taxes. Even liquor stores kind of struggling in business.
Speaker D:
Do we get billed from Crystal if we utilize your canine?
Speaker B:
Not typically, no.
Speaker F:
No.
Speaker B:
Yeah I shared with PD. If that's something that we're going to consider they're going to have to come and talk to council about it.
Speaker D:
And how many calls do we have a year?
Speaker B:
That's the kind of data that they can provide. You know anecdotally they can share. During the last couple of weeks with the missing persons we have wait for the next neighbor. I don't think it was crystal. I think we waited for new hope personal is found which is great but sometimes that extra 20 minutes is a big deal.
Speaker D:
Thanks.
Speaker B:
Any other thoughts?
Speaker F:
I still. I think we can add the people. Typically we have a nothing people for the last at least ten years. I don't remember adding people but I guess we must have some time. It seemed to me that there's a time when we had 90 x like 93 full time equivalents and now we're at 88 authorized but we actually only have 77 today. You know, you can clarify those numbers. I feel okay having a budget deficit. Given the fact that we have an $800,000 projection of overage this year thinking we would have had 240,000 under. So we're over a million better than what we thought we'd be. I don't like budget deficit budgeting but I feel okay that we're just not going to get there next year. With seven additional police officers comprising 54% of our budget departments that work. If we budget deficit, deficit budget. I'm not going to end up in a deficit. I'm okay with going whatever. Adding the people I guess.
Speaker B:
So.
Speaker E:
I don't know the answer to this question. I kind of agree with you. But I'm also curious of like what's the worst case scenario if let's say, you know, massive winter, tons of snowstorms like whoa. We actually do end up using more over time and we're in a deficit. Does that then immediately like will that we'll have to account for that in the next year's budget or how does that play out?
Speaker B:
So the council sets its own policy by way of what amount of reserves we keep on hand. 50% is great in Barb. We get two installments from the county. Operationally we have to have so much in the bank for the first half of the year until we get the payment. It's also. It's just. It's good financial responsibility. If you start to build it up. We're in a 40 to 60 to 50. Is the current policy getting a little bit above 50? Now you start to ask why are you setting such a high levy that if you're not going to spend it, that do you really need to have more than half of your operating? Getting below that 40 is in the danger zone of what you're talking about. So to the mayor's comment, if, you know, we go all in on deficit. You didn't say go all in. If we go all in on deficit budgeting, the risk we run is to the finance director's point, a downturn in the economy means unemployment shrinks. It's easier to find employees, we fill all the positions and now we get down into the high thirties of reserves. So we have to make that up the next year. Now that's like a worst case scenario, but it's kind of. It's forecasting out. So I would agree that, you know, one way to cut some of this is to increase that deficit. I think we do have some safety there. I would not recommend absorbing all of it for those reasons.
Speaker H:
I think like September levy is fine, that we have time till December to reduce it, but if we reduce it now to what everyone expectation, there's no room in December.
Speaker B:
You can't go back up.
Speaker H:
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker A:
So I mean, I'm comfortable with.
Speaker B:
The.
Speaker A:
Council member asked if you. Yeah, you mentioned eight to nine and 9.9. I'm comfortable with that. I think I agree with the mayor and Jason as well. It seems that's reasonable what you're saying. So do you like the eight and 9.9? Is that.
Speaker F:
Yeah, I'm okay with ten. Is it? I'm okay with ten. And then yeah, I kind of am okay with your twelve, but I don't know. I do not want to end up at twelve.
Speaker D:
You know, I think somebody at the end of the table here will let the public know. We started at twelve.
Speaker B:
And due to the financial brilliance of the council.
Speaker D:
Can we get a breakdown of that surplus of the 800,000.
Speaker H:
As many of the vacant position, many police and one in engineering.
Speaker B:
Police engineering. We did some. I forget what we bought for salt this spring, but we had a huge costing going in. Now, again, this is up to say we could force you to snow between the numbers.
Speaker D:
Right.
Speaker B:
I know we had some cost savings there. Remember that figure? I don't know if it was six figures, but.
Speaker G:
No, I don't think it was six.
Speaker F:
Figures, but it was substantial.
Speaker G:
But, yeah, I'm always reluctant to count those chickens until we get to the 31 December.
Speaker B:
Positions.
Speaker H:
What was project wherever officer. But most of the time between ten and 20 short of stuff. But the cadet program, I think they are now five and they are about to hire the 6th person in cadet. So it's a matter of time that we keep adding it for officer.
Speaker B:
Yeah, the cadet program is long game in that it's like a two to four year investment. Assuming they work out and we're getting close to one, they're going to come off the program and go into the FTO program. So it's incentivizing like a lot of trades that will help out with some school costs, will give you a couple of years experience, you know, working with the public, us seeing if you are, you know, going to be a good officer or not. And then we'll go into that FTO and a new officer one. So we've got one that's coming out.
Speaker D:
That really is for a new company.
Speaker B:
That to do that replacement here next week. So we're starting to see that that was a new program that you guys approved as a part of this year. So we went a little bit heavier on the cadet side to try and do that long term. You know, same thing. It's got that beyond the cadet program, once they're in, they got to stay on for three years or they got to pay back tuition in the three year mark. Kind of gives us, gives any personnel a bit of incentive to stick around. Your vacation starts to accrue, you know, the community, you like the organization by that point. So that's where the cadet is kind of on game. But some of that's going to be another two, three years old.
Speaker D:
Another reason I'm asking Tayern's point is that we don't need to budget, I think for so many officers because we.
Speaker B:
Have the best on the challenge.
Speaker H:
From your own budget, you cannot hire.
Speaker B:
Right.
Speaker D:
We don't need a budget for seven when we haven't hired more than one in a year in the last five years. I'm just making those numbers up, but no.
Speaker B:
So, yeah.
Speaker A:
Any other thoughts? I think sounds like we have something direction, if you.
Speaker B:
So we can this page. I don't have my page numbers, the tax rate examples as part of your item a, that last page in there, we'll come back with that chart with an 8% and 9.9%, and we'll dial in some language directly tied to council goals and priorities, call some things out. Now, all that said, we've got a little bit of time between now and September work session, so we're going to essentially have to put to the staff together. Finance director's not going to like to hear this. Two versions of what we approved on September 17. We can do some of that. We'll do the legwork in between. I'll work with you in the next week or two to figure out where we'll call. But that work session gives you one week before the September 17 meeting where you'll make that decision. So just as a reminder, that'll come quick and share that in. We as staff are here. If you've got questions specific to these materials or things we've done in the past, please reach out. We'd be happy to schedule some time with you one on one.
Speaker G:
Great.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker A:
Oh, mayor.
Speaker F:
No, I don't care. So looking at this chart here at 10%, which is essentially 9.911 million, $211,000 is how much we're going to levy. Then we have enterprise funds that we collect money on. So what does. How much is our total intake in a year of revenues? Levy that we have, the fiscal disparities we get, the LGA that we get, and the enterprise funds that we get. How much money do we take in? Is like. Is it 24 million, 26 million?
Speaker B:
Northern 30.
Speaker F:
Okay. North of $30 million.
Speaker B:
Okay.
Speaker F:
Okay.
Speaker H:
Just a clarification about September original planning just to reduce the levy, increase the deficit, or negotiating the three new position or potion. Okay. Yeah.
Speaker B:
We'll come up with something to make those numbers work.
Speaker A:
Anything else before we move on? All right, cool.
Speaker B:
Let's go on to the next one.
Speaker A:
Which I think is the assessment. Assessment policy discussion.
Speaker B:
Yeah. So I'll introduce again, Richard's here to talk about logistics, if we've got any questions. I know Dia's excited to get this one moving forward, too. I'll start at the end of this one. We as staff want direction when we walk out tonight as to setting these assessment Hubble so we can go forward with public hearing and get these done, because the work starts with this on next Monday. So we're at a point that we can do it in this order, but we do need to. We do need to get this done. And I share that in part. Part of the conversation we had back to the spring was addressing the assessment policy in totality, and I'll get into it a little bit while why, but staff does absolutely not agree with doing that today. If we want to do that long term, I think we got to be strategic and build it up. So we've got some numbers here that I'll run through, but there's a brief history. Back on the 2 April, staff presented the 2024 street improvement feasibility report. This is for 41st. All that went through came back on the 7 May. At that point, council did not provide enough rules to advance the process. We then revisited ordering of the work in June without going through the special assessments as a part of that process, which we are allowed to do. Again, as a reminder, you know, I set this with the budget. I did attach the special assessment policy as part of your packet here. It's 20 pages. Again, if you don't look at it every day, it can be french. But we as a city under statute, have the authority to specially assess for things like street, alley, curb and gutter, sidewalks and trails, storm sewer, sanitary water, main, street lights, acquisition, construction. There are a variety of things that we can specially assess for in this circumstance. This is again for 41st. And scrolling down here, the assessment role indicated a range of $3,800 and changed to $12,584. A big part of this standing out. Recent history doesn't have these kind of numbers. 41st Avenue is going to be, again to be done, because we've gone through this a few times, but it's going to be the long side of people's properties. Part of our assessment policy that includes perlineal foot says that it's only half of that. So if you have two sides, say a 75 by 150 foot property, the 150 foot is divided in half, so you're assessed for only 75ft of that, not the rate of the whole thing.
Speaker F:
Because you're on the corner.
Speaker B:
Because you're on the corner, so you don't get assessed, don't get that double whammy. So even with that, because it's the longer property, that 75ft is still longer than some people's front controls, that can be 40, 50ft on the front of the street. Again, the assessment is based on per lineal foot. We use a construction index for that. I do have, though, that I pass around. I should have started with that. Two things I've been passed around. This is a copy of the assessment roll. Just make sure that council gets these. Can certainly happen. There's ten. And then this one here shows the pergola yellow foot in recent history.
Speaker H:
A.
Speaker B:
Bit of history for the meeting. We had good attendance. Of the eleven people, I'd say that's probably the highest percentage of people that ever showed up for specially assessed. Eight or nine were there, understandably so. And there were two major pieces that we as staff understand. One was the amount of notice. So in that April may time period, people being told that this would go on, the assessment of November, that seemed quick. There was also, again, like I mentioned, the total we're used to seeing three, four, $5,000 special assessments, seeing 12,000. That's a big jump. So all that's to say what we put together here to better understand, let me say one more thing before we go forward. The third thing that I should include interest rate. There was a question about interest rate and how we determine that. So we shared that. That's the prime plus two is traditionally about our history here. So if you go onto the second page of your memo related to special assessments, chart includes the history by year, it's got the project listed by year going back to 2017, as well as 4% in 2021. And, well, it's fair to say that this year seemed high at 6.65% and that was 65 points higher than last year. The second column in there shows the average assessment from each of those projects, again, in that 4000, 506,000 range, whereas this year we saw an average of nine. So your perception there was not option. The second piece here that talks about special assessment policy in general, we can get to in a little bit. But again, what I want to walk away with while you're looking at that first chart, identify a percentage and then we can reverse engineering. But if you can give us a number, we will per linear foot go through with assessing that process. So if it's being closer to average that you think is fair, that again, the last two years, 5000, 806,000, 206,500, and you think the last couple of years, again, interest rates were more in line with, they should be 4.556%. Those are the two numbers that we need to walk away with here tonight. That said, I do want to jump into that last page that's got the final chart on there. A big reason. We're not advocating to just rip the band aid off here. And I should know we as staff would love to do that to get rid of these special assessment policy for these types of projects. It's not going to be fair. We did, again using those same projects looking back to 2017, you can see by way of this is the 24 levy, how much we would have to add on to do those properties by taking special assessments away. That combined with there are some property owners paying these things off over ten years. So if we go to the person that's two years into a ten year program and say, well, this guy's not paying assessments, but you still have to pay yours for the next year, that doesn't seem fair. So what we would advocate for longer term is to phase it out over a number of years, potentially eight or ten years. Some cities have some very good ways of doing this. So again, in staff's recommendation, that's a conversation for another day, potentially with new consulate on the first of the year. So hopefully it makes sense what we're looking to do here tonight. But again, that percentage in dollars, either by way of total or bye, which we can figure out is what we need direction on, is that.
Speaker G:
No, that covers it pretty well. I mean, I think your correct staff would. I would jump for joy if I didn't have to do assessment hearings and all of that anymore. But you know what we heard, we spoke to the attorneys about it, and they actually said that they use our assessment policy as a good model policy when they're talking to other cities. And there's been a lot of thought going to the assessment policy and refined it over the years to try and be as equitable as we possibly can. You know, we've got numerous safeguards in there with regard to properties with multiple frontages, only pay for half of each frontage. We've got the 8% safety net, if you like. If an assessment amount gets to be 8% of the property value, cap it 8% again, just to try and be as equitable as possible. Knowing the kind of range of homes that we have here in the city. And to be honest, for the 20 plus years that we've been using it, in the time I've been here, it's worked pretty darn well. You know, I had to sit there and calculate the amount of special assessments we've worked out using this policy. I think the other indicator that it works pretty well is that over all that time, I think we've only had, like, three challenges for all of the properties that we've ever assessed. We've only had three people come up and say no. If we disagree with that, we want to take you to court. And none of them have ever got the court. There are anomalies from time to time with odd shaped lots and what have you. And we bring that to the city council at the hearing time. And the city council has been really good at listening to residents and taking staff advice and amending some of those assessment amounts based on funny shapes of lots and what have you. Like that. I think it's been a really good effort to make this thing as, I guess, as painless as possible, because it's not a very nice process to have to go through. Go to someone and say, hey, we're reconstructing your street. I'm going to collect six, $7,000 off you for the pleasure of doing that. So, yeah, I think it works pretty well. I'm open to exploring ways of phasing it out over time. I think that will be a very delicate dance to make that happen.
Speaker B:
Councillor. Yeah.
Speaker D:
So we already agreed, I think, in our last meeting, that we were going.
Speaker B:
To put the mandate off, that we.
Speaker D:
Would do it over time. And I will challenge you. It's worked great for staff as procedural, but it doesn't work well for residents when they're getting a $10,000 bill. That's who I'm speaking for, is the residents. And it's not so much our current policy and how it operates and how we do it. It's the burden on the residents almost triple, certainly over double in the data you gave us from 2017 to this year, the average assessment has gone up. And people don't complain because they don't have any recourse. They kind of accept it and just, okay, it is what it is because nobody wants to pay that amount of money. Nobody is happy about it. And I think we can do better. And so I think they're all in agreement that it doesn't make sense to just rip off the band aid and add 7% to our levy. It is not fair for people that are going to pay over a number of years. But I certainly think over a time period of whether it's ten or 15, if we can titrate down the. What is CCI? Is that a construction index?
Speaker G:
Construction post index.
Speaker D:
Okay. You know, just titrating that down. So we just reduce the average assessment over time. I think that would be reasonable.
Speaker G:
I think as a valid points that you might. I think the project this year is not a typical project because it's just side lots. And that's why you're seeing that vast increase of the averages over a regular project. The one last year that the Hubbard Avenue, I mean, that was pretty much all 40 foot, 50 foot frontages. So that's why you're seeing such a difference. If we were to do another project that was all slight streets, you're going to see the same kind. It's just the nature of how the policy works. And, you know, I don't know. I still think for a policy that you have to write for the majority of people, I think the policy works well.
Speaker D:
I mean, it is in a sense how it exists. Somewhat certainly regressive because you can have the exact same lot, two different valued homes. You know, it's much like a sales tax. It's the same for everybody, but it's a different percentage of incomes. So for some.
Speaker B:
Right.
Speaker D:
So it's, it's regressive in that sense. What I'm suggesting would not be regressive because it would eventually be based on your property taxes and the value of your home and failure to pay, which.
Speaker B:
I think is more equitable.
Speaker D:
But my other issue is with this particular project, you have sewer and water that benefits the entire city, not to mention the roads that these residents, because they were the leather bearing abroad at the cost of the project. Now, if it's just their water line and there's a water main break, we know that up to the city water line residents are responsible for that. I'm not talking about those types of projects, specifically more of the, these larger projects that include infrastructure that benefits everybody. It doesn't increase the property value necessarily for these individuals that have to bear this burden that just pops up on them. So I don't know that we are suggesting we do anything different for this project. I thought we can establish, move forward as we proved that we voted on it. So you're not asking.
Speaker B:
So we still need to approve an assessment rule.
Speaker G:
Yeah, we didn't do this. We did the improvement hearing.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker G:
Which allows us to construct it. We still have to have the assessment.
Speaker D:
Here and I think we can move forward with that. I don't think there was any. I think this discussion was kind of after the fact. It's going to take a longer conversation. And I encourage, I mean, this is going to happen probably, maybe next year, but I'd encourage city council to continue to look at it.
Speaker B:
So what I can clarify here, this one here, this was the original assessment. Under the statute, you as counsel have the authority to magically adjustment debt interest rate, which was one of the things that I thought was too high and assessed by this per linear foot. Now that was after extensive conversation with our attorney. And I was a little, little surprised by that because that's been our standard. But as long as we charge by perlineal foot, we can reduce that number. So this year is at $1.33, $0.88. So if you're at 150ft, that times this, divide it in half at that 50% rate. That's where your total comes from. Us council has the authority to reduce this 133 ADHD.
Speaker D:
I got you.
Speaker B:
And that's what we're looking to do. Because we're still a staff, we're not advocating that we remove assessments altogether.
Speaker D:
Thanks for clarifying that. Yeah, I mean, we have a surplus.
Speaker G:
We could.
Speaker D:
I'd advocate for, you know, lowering it a little bit, not eliminating it, or adjusting interest rate, which I think you suggest.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
Mayor so the cool thing is that you and I, other than this particular project, we probably have the least to say about this because today we're one fifth of the vote and eventually we're going to be 115 thousandth of the vote. But with regard to this particular project, now I'm going to go with the whole policy first. The whole policy. I think it is fair. I think these people, you know, if you're going to go to Maple Grove and go to a lot and it's in a cornfield, you're going to pay this because you got to put water and sewer and all the services in.
Speaker B:
Front of your lot.
Speaker F:
We've done this for many years. I think maybe on this project, these poor people that are getting $10,000 of assessments, I think they're maybe paying like 6% of the whole project. It's varied between 22 and 6%. And this one's one of the. I mean, it's a whole reconstruction. And this is going to come to my street. I'm adding up these numbers on page seven of 53, which Richard's pointed out before, over ten years. $3,552,000, easy mathematic. $355,000 a year. Go to our 10% 12% table that we have. We're going to have to increase the taxes on all the citizens. If we would absorb $355,000 per year by just spreading this everywhere, we're going to have to absorb 4%. Everybody's taxes are going to go up 4%. My turn is going to come. My turn came when I had a 4004 quail and I had an alley in my backyard. That's. Now, these people that came in, they were the nicest people, but they. Most all but one. One complained, really about the highness of it. The most others complained. This is high, but give me some time. So we. I think we should tell them two years ahead of time. This, you are in the ten year plan, but now you're in the two year plan. Warning, warning, warning. And then one year ahead. Warning, warning, warning. I just don't think we can raise the taxes on everybody so much to cover this. I would continue with the policy just the way it is. And apparently as a model for other places, it sucks, but I mean, and it is regressive, but property tax as a whole whole is regressive. I mean, income tax is more fair as far as being progressive. So, yeah, this is regressive. I think we should. But we should give them some relief. You could say, you know, I brought this forward, give them 2025, no interest for the calendar year 2025. And, yeah, maybe reduce it to 5% or something, but I just think the policy is a good policy to support the staff.
Speaker A:
Councilor, appreciation.
Speaker C:
Yeah, thank you. I don't feel as strongly about giving input tonight on what the future of the policy is. I am both open to a phased out plan over 15 years. I think I would feel more comfortable with, but I. I also didn't have strong feelings about the policy until this issue came up. But what I also heard from that meeting were the folks who were concerned about the notice and, and the interest rate. So I. I'm in agreement with what's in the recommendation here to maintain that interest rate of 0% through 2025. I also think 5% is a reasonable interest rate to start at that point in 2025. And then I think what I want to find a solution for in the shorter term for the next assessment is the. Or the next round of assessments is the communication aspect with enough notice. Those are the two that I heard, as the mayor mentioned, folks caring about more with this group, with this project.
Speaker A:
100% agree with Councilor Parisian. That was my takeaway too, is that folks just needed more notice. So I'm definitely open to talking about phasing it out. I think it's, you know, I need to think about it more, but it seems like a reasonable option. But as we phase it out, I think we should incorporate into the policy a much longer lead up time to when the amount is due and. Yeah, and just like Mia said, I think the recommendation here is creative and good. So through 2025, and then just for my own benefit, and maybe anybody else says, just needs a refresher, just property taxes. Where are those coming from?
Speaker B:
Right.
Speaker A:
Residential, commercial, like what is not what properties, maybe easier way to just say it is which properties aren't generating property tax.
Speaker B:
Schools, nonprofits, churches, so one of the things in post office.
Speaker A:
So maybe the post office is leasing that space in that mall.
Speaker B:
Right.
Speaker A:
So the mall itself is checking property tax. But if the post office had its own building, it probably would.
Speaker B:
Okay, so maybe what you're going after. One of the reasons some people favor a special assessment policy is, say, for example, some of these larger churches, they don't pay a property tax. So this is a way for them to contribute to these types of efforts. Okay. Yeah, great.
Speaker A:
Helps paint the picture for me. But, yeah, I think it's. If the future council at the beginning of next year wants to talk about reducing it over a long period of time, I'd be happy to entertain that. I think I'm open to it. So, yeah, as a recommendation here, I think that's good to me.
Speaker G:
It's interesting to note that for many, many years, the League of Minnesota Cities and the City Engineers association have been trying to get us a street utility passed at the legislature, which would just be like all your other utilities. It's kind of a pain as you go, which I actually think is a lot fairer because if you live in a street for 20 years, you pay 20 years worth of your contributions. You know, with a special assessment, you could live in a street for 20 years, leave the year before was due to be reconstructed, and you have paid zero era. So, you know, but for some reason, the legislature doesn't favor a street utility and despite numerous attempts, it's never gotten up in that arena. But I think that would be a really, really equitable way of being able to charge for all of this without then having to go through the process of hearings and, and all of that sort of business.
Speaker D:
I mean, you had mentioned supporting what staff supports, but you had mentioned before you do support eliminating.
Speaker G:
Oh, I special, trust me, I would love not to have to go through all the hearing business because, you know, as a staff member, I've got certain requirements. I have to do due diligence on a whole bunch of stuff, even just to get notices out and all the rest of it. So it's kind of an administrative red tape that I'd be joyful to get rid of getting the letters out in advance for the ten year burner.
Speaker D:
Thanks for doing this. I agree with everything else on the recommendations. Appreciate it.
Speaker B:
So I want to know what we will propose, and correct me if I'm wrong, is you still need to record to the county this year. So we would propose, timing would be such. First meeting in October, maybe, maybe second. We'll have to double check yeah, I've.
Speaker G:
Got to check because with assessments, there's a long period of time we have.
Speaker B:
To notify so we'll get a proper notice. We will include notice that the. This will include a 0% rate for that first year. But the caveat is this is payable for the county. So once we put it on the assessment, there's no interest accruing. But people that carry that will have to make that payment to them. Following that, we will have an interest rate of five.
Speaker F:
Is that what you said? Me five or. I said five?
Speaker B:
5%. Okay. And am I understanding correctly that the totals that were originally on the assessment rule are agreed upon?
Speaker A:
Okay, great. Let's do the next four.
Speaker C:
I have one quick question. So, for the folks on the roll, are they getting any other communication about this decision or is that on them to.
Speaker B:
So we'll put on notification again, I.
Speaker G:
Will work it into the letter that we send them that was discussed by city council. And, you know, the following represents, you know, the way we're proposing it now.
Speaker C:
Perfect. Thank you.
Speaker F:
Which is different than the old way in there. You have one year going.
Speaker G:
Yes. It will be interest free until the 15 November 2025.
Speaker F:
Is it a ten year situation assessment? You could even calculate an APR. The APR is not going to be 5% because you get the first year free. The APR is going to be in the fours. So that would be a good thing to tell them.
Speaker G:
I'd have to get Dee to help.
Speaker F:
Somebody should be able to do that.
Speaker G:
All those financial functions give me engineering functions. I'm great at calculus. Yeah.
Speaker D:
Okay, real quick, just thanks, council and staff for addressing this and looking at.
Speaker B:
It, talking about it.
Speaker D:
Appreciate it.
Speaker A:
So let's go on to the RT.
Speaker B:
Yeah. Thank you, Mayor Pro Tem. So bringing back this ongoing conversation, I want to lay out a few big dates we've got coming up next Wednesday. We're doing an open house over in Elam, six to eight, that was council had asked for. We can talk about this right now to the back end. We're still flushing out some ideas. One thought was, so you can take your individual feedback that puts you in position. We'll get rolls up, you can hear from people. We will have staff that are too encouraged to participate in the survey, get written feedback. All that will be presented to you before the decision making this book, consent. You can record feedback however you like. We would offer if council wants a staff member nearby. We can do that. If you're presenting with somebody in the weeds things, or maybe not sure properly myself. Richard, Heather, we can find a couple others. So that's something to think about for next Wednesday. Then we will formally host the public hearing and we'll formally host the public hearing hearing at the first meeting in September. Council will take feedback at the council meeting. No action will be taken. And then the vote on municipal consent will be September 17, the second meeting. So it's, we are required to have a public hearing. I think probably technically could have hit it with the open house, but this is something we kicked around and council wanted this progression this past spring that we talked about, some of the follow up from the last conversation, there were questions from public safety, which Chief Barold and Chief Foley, you know, in reaching out to Hopkins, Boington and a couple others that have seen play relief, it was difficult to quantify some of the data. So some of the things related to required training, there's uncertainty there. You know, we've got a part time fire department, so it's hard to compare to Minneapolis, who has a full time and already does some training. So those are things we need to continue to flush out. So we do maintain some general language in those observations. But we didn't really come up with much by way of data since we're, we've got unique constraints here. Some of the specific things that council also asks for a, at the last discussion, putting together sort of a timeline of what we've communicated to the project office. Of course, this is an ongoing conversation that's been going on for years, regular meetings from staff, bi weekly, irts to, they've come out and done open houses to their own functions that we've been a part of. So what we just did, rather than capturing all of that, some of the formal concerns that we identified in early 2023, if a letter was sent off to then the project director, Chris Beckwith, that letter is including your pack in your. This last spring, the project office came and presented, I think it was the second meeting in January. We're here. We walked through some things. Some questions were answered, some concerns were expressed. Following that, we formed up this list that we've sort of been editing for the last several months that you have seen in different fashions titled CC Considerations LRT graph. That's a second, the third item in here, and I can walk through this if people haven't been through. But as a reminder, we had a higher additional council. We use Kennedy Graven for a lot of city functions, but they discovered a conflict as they got some involvement with the project office. So Jared shepherd of Campbell Knudsen wrote an opinion for us really confirming that the municipal consent process has three options rather than what we had been talking about potential for, which is this a.
Speaker F:
Public letter now people can see this. This is not attorney client code.
Speaker D:
Okay.
Speaker B:
There is a second version if you like. A second version.
Speaker D:
Okay.
Speaker B:
But this is, this says the same thing.
Speaker F:
Okay.
Speaker B:
So there are three versions of that. That's his opinion. We're dialing in on the same page now. So that confirms us. Council, you've really got three options. One, do nothing, which is would result in providing municipal consent, I should say do not take no action. One, take action by saying yes to municipal consent. The third is to say no to municipal consent. Depending part of that, you're required to include what needs to be addressed.
Speaker F:
And these three options are exactly what the blue line people told us were our three options.
Speaker B:
That's right.
Speaker F:
Okay.
Speaker B:
One of the things council has also mentioned asking for, and we've been encouraged that there's been an uptick in formally meeting with North Memorial. And the project outputs some initial comments. So hopefully everybody had a chance to read through that letter. There's a letter and a supplement. We will continue to be a part of those conversations. And then the last, we pulled out some slides from the last CMC meeting specific to ridership forecasts. This is a blended version from 2019, 2022 and 2023, in large part for justification for the park. So all those things, I'm going to be happy to walk through anything, respond any questions, comments, concerns you guys have. So is Heather, so is Richard. But really tonight we need to have a conversation with council as to framing up two resolutions, one that says consent and one that says, we know you as a counselor are going to have to decide that in total, the three of you are going to have to decide that if no is an option, if Noah is an option, what is included on that? I've got two, I think high level ones that occur ongoing. The elevated structure and the parking structure. Those are conversations that council need to address. And if there are other things that we want to include in that, we got to start getting this outlet now. This isn't to say this is the last mention things we've got coming up, but I say it in part. I think we're at a point where we're willing as staff to let some of these things go. We've got a pretty lengthy list. Part of that was that's what she asked us to do several months ago, get in the weeds, talk about term lanes, talk about takings, talk about plannings. I think us council can give us direction to continue those conversations. We don't want to lose greenery. We want to ensure access to this. We want to be sure that these things are happening, but maybe it's not to the level that it's included. No resolution on municipal consent. All that said, you know, you don't need to start from scratch, but the vast majority of those things can probably.
Speaker E:
Come off that list.
Speaker B:
So I started with those two. I went out for council. We started talking about those two, and there are other things. So we got up the most recent mobiles. Excuse my tape job, quickly, but if we want to get into it, we can certainly throw stuff up on the tv. But you as council need to start deciding where we want to go here. We're not taking a vote tonight. We're not saying this is what we're doing tonight, but if we are going to write two versions of the resolution that will ultimately vote on the 17th, we maybe only vote on one.
Speaker D:
Already.
Speaker B:
We got a circuit dialed in here.
Speaker A:
All of this provided enough thought right.
Speaker B:
Away, I think so.
Speaker A:
In the letter from the attorney from the.
Speaker B:
I guess. Yeah. Law firm, right? Attorney.
Speaker A:
Yeah, that's right. Term attempt to engage by counsel negotiations, MoU addressing non design plan related concerns. Maybe what I would offer is that we go through our list, find those non design items, and start trying to get an MMU together to bring to the Met council. And then when it comes to, since it seems like we can't really have any, like riders or however you want to describe it on a yes vote, that any resolution that's doing a no should include the design related plans in our list. That's what it seems like to me, would be the way to go about it. So, including the two things you mentioned, but any other things like helipad or turn style, like stuff? I don't know, but I think those are financial thoughts. Yeah.
Speaker F:
Jason.
Speaker E:
Thank you. So there's a lot of things on this list, and when I look at the statute, it's pretty specific about being related to route and stations. So I guess my question would be, I mean, it sounds like setting up for a yes vote would just be a resolution that we're saying yes, and then a disapproved vote will have the specific amendments, what we want to see changed, but those specific things need to be route and station related. You mentioned the parking ramp, and I'm wondering, does that fit into the criteria of route and stations?
Speaker B:
So, to answer in two parts, some of what's on the list, staff believes falls within statutory guidelines some of those things are not. Do not have the. They're not shared by Project Optimus, folks. Okay. So I think there's some gray area there. The second part of that we all but confirm in a hypothetical, if the development were to happen on us bank and we go through whatever process with the design currently having a parking structure at US bank, if that changes again, all but confirmed, there would be a new municipal consent form required. Now, I don't. It's not clear to me that that includes the entire corridor, but that would be a big enough change, and we'd have to go through the process again.
Speaker E:
So that means yes is part of route and station. If we would have to vote. If something changed with the parking structure, we'd have to vote. Have another municipal consent vote. That means that, like, we can include it in our response.
Speaker B:
Okay, good. So again, my understanding we have nothing explicit. These are the things that I would advise you as counsel, to err on the side of. What's the opposite of caution?
Speaker F:
On the side of the expansion of what the. What your rights are.
Speaker E:
Yeah, push that.
Speaker B:
I would advise you to do that in that if there is a fight, if we don't mention these things, they're off the table. Okay.
Speaker E:
I like that. Can I ask one other question?
Speaker F:
You just did.
Speaker E:
Okay, so then in the process of this MoU, can we have our amendments? But we will determine amendments if we go down this disapprove route, can we also submit, like, hey, here's some other things that we like separately from the municipal consent process. Would the city feel comfortable sending a list of, like, here's some other stuff that we're considering. And I guess that applies to yes or no, but I think it's separate from the.
Speaker A:
I would. In my mind, I would just, you know, separate it completely. It's like, you can make an MOU for. At any time of the day, I would think, for anything. So, yeah, I think we should.
Speaker B:
We should try to do that. I would view it as sort of a Venn diagram. There's overlap between the two. So again, you know, there's no harm in being redundant between two than if we want to list things on both. The MOU is a good question. This, literally, we got this letter last week. I think it's an interesting idea. I don't know the appetite of the project out for this further, the bearing, the standard of what that MLM carries. I don't know. We can write it in a way that they're going to want to say, we'll have every best intention to fulfill these things. I don't know what that means in the end, but monuments, that language. So, to council member Wagner's point, they're probably separate with some overlap. So, again, what I would advise counsel is to be both.
Speaker E:
And then the last thing I'll say. And then I want to listen as long as I can before I say anything else. But no, I forgot what I was going to say. I don't know. Drawing a blank on what I was going to say.
Speaker D:
I'll come back.
Speaker E:
Yeah, it was good. It was really good. So I'll get it.
Speaker D:
I'll get it back.
Speaker C:
Tim, you mentioned that there might be some things on this list that staff might be willing to let go of. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to share, even, like, general themes of what those are generally.
Speaker B:
You know, I'm at a point where I think it's in the best interest of council to monument what's very much possible on deal. So I'll give examples of some. We've had concerns about loss of turn lanes. There's some things on this list that.
Speaker F:
The current version shows.
Speaker B:
An example I'll give. For a long time, they were proposing shutting off a left turn going south on 81 into either boat access. But that's a very highly used recreational thing here in town.
Speaker F:
The crystal lake one.
Speaker B:
You're talking about Antwerp. So most recent versions now include that open. So we don't want to let that go, because things can happen between 30 and 60%. But that's the kind of thing that if you don't want to, you know, lie on the hill for, we'd be happy to get rid of. I think you need to. I don't know what the number is. I think you guys need to. If this is the direction you want to go and monument, the handful of things make very clear. Does that answer your question? I'm sorry, that may be a little bit fagged, but when you look through the list, there are some things that are so in the weeds that.
Speaker C:
Yeah, it does. Thank you.
Speaker E:
I remembered.
Speaker B:
Can I go? Okay.
Speaker E:
So, for example, you mentioned elevating through 42nd as a thing. Do you envision that between now and this municipal consent vote, that we are going to get a response from the project that addresses that concern?
Speaker F:
No.
Speaker B:
I believe you'll get a response.
Speaker F:
Between now and the municipal consent, but.
Speaker B:
I don't know that it's going to address the concerns.
Speaker F:
On.
Speaker G:
Is there?
Speaker A:
Mayor goes.
Speaker B:
Oh, sure, sure.
Speaker F:
It's relevant to this. On the tour that I just took with Representative Omar from Brooklyn park to Target Field to the Hayward place. Basically, I, after that tour, I asked Nick the engineer, landweirder Landweather. I asked him, because I heard them saying, I heard Dan Solar say, and so we'll discuss. I get. I got to give a little bit of a talk as we were in Robbinsdale, and I shared it with Dan Solar because he knows more about it than me. But I said, then we want to have right here, representative, a overpass for 41st and 42nd public safety. And Dan Solar said, well, we'll be discussing that with the city of Robinson. I heard that as saying, no, we're not going to do that. And then I asked the engineer, Nick Landwehr, how much would be the cost of that? I won't hold you to that. And he said, yeah, I don't know, but $50 to $100 million, they are not going to approve.
Speaker B:
They should.
Speaker F:
They're putting highway 81 over Bass Lake Road because crystal wants it. That's going to cost more than $100 million. But for us, we're just a little city, and we're not going to get that. But that's why I think that should be in there. And anyway, that's one of our main things, and they're not going to do that in my estimation. So I jump in for a reading.
Speaker D:
I was just wondering if we could get consensus on voting no with conditions.
Speaker B:
Start there.
Speaker F:
I'm not going to. I want this project to go forward. I'm not going to vote yes because they're not where they need to be.
Speaker C:
I am. I'm open to pulling that lever. Yes. And as I've stated before, the thing that I care most about is a non design element of this with the anti displacement work. So I would feel strongest that that is included in an MoU.
Speaker E:
In an MoU rather than the in tandem.
Speaker C:
So, like, we're talking about doing both. Like to put that on the record. So. And then, I guess in terms of the elevation and the parking ramp, I don't know if we're getting into that conversation. It's not. The elevation is not the one that I. The hill that I'm choosing. And with the parking ramp, I think with the current design of it being at us bank, I know we've had conversations about whether or not we want the parking structure. I do. So I think we'll get into that in a little bit. But to answer your initial question, yes, I do feel comfortable with conditions.
Speaker D:
We all vote now, as far as the parking ramp goes, I think I'd be comfortable if, again, I won't be here soon, but if we said we, we would need another municipal consent to approve any sort of parking, because, again, you might look at some of the ridership data that they shared. And I just am not confident in their ability to forecast the size we need with the information we currently have. And I'm sure all of you drive by metro transit parking ramps. None of them are full. And I'm sure there's opportunities, opportunity to expand or to build more if we need that capacity. So I just want to. I don't have to say no, we're not going to do it, but I definitely want to have something there that says, we want more information, we're open to it, but we need to approve again the where and what. So I think that is, I think, important for help. So that's how the parking. I get. We need some parking, but I'm just not confident in their projections or what they're proposing. That's my concern.
Speaker B:
But.
Speaker D:
Okay, well, we start. We got a start there. So then it's just the conditions.
Speaker F:
We didn't hear what.
Speaker A:
So, yeah, I was gonna. Yeah, I just wanted to say, like, I think if no is gonna pass at this moment, I don't. I don't feel like I'm gonna vote again. I want the project. I understand that this whole process and the statute is, there's a lot to be desired, but I don't know. I still feel like my neighbors. I want the project to go through, and me voting no on it, I think, is, you know, explaining the nuances. I can do that for sure, but I think I would be doing them. I still feel like I'd be doing them a disservice if I voted no, so. But if it seems like no is going to pass, then we should load it with stuff to people's points. But, yeah, I'm. Yeah, I still want to show support for the project because that's what I feel like I was elected to do, and saying no seems antithetical to that, although we know ins and outs of the process. But at this moment, I'm not sold one way or the other. But I think if we're going to know it's going to pass, we should be strategic about it, even if I don't necessarily want that outcome.
Speaker D:
Well, the whole thing is being strategic. That's the whole point of voting no, it's not. You're voting no to the project. You're voting no to how it's designed and just food for thought. Like, yes, you won an election. But you don't really know what people voted. They might have not just liked the other guy. Right.
Speaker G:
So you don't.
Speaker D:
You know, I know you feel passionate about it, but, you know, I wouldn't look at it that, like, I have this directive I need to do your job, really, is to do what's best for Robinson at the end of the day. And I think voting no with these conditions is how we get that done. So I think. I mean, like you said, you get the nuances and voting no to house currently designed, not the project. But I think that's how we leverage and get what we need to make it the best project.
Speaker G:
Yeah, I appreciate that.
Speaker A:
Yeah, I appreciate that insight.
Speaker D:
Can I just comment to that?
Speaker E:
So I will say that the flip side of that is that voting yes is saying that we're good with the project the way that it is, which we are.
Speaker B:
Nothing.
Speaker E:
I don't think. I'm not getting that sense. This is only my second work session of listening to this, but based on what I heard in the last one, I didn't get the sense that everyone's like, yep, 100%, this is the way I design it. This is the way it should be. And I love this design. Which is, to me, what yes would mean by. I mean, again, the whole point of the project or the whole point of this municipal consent process is getting to a place where we are approving the project. I mean, it's like, if we take no action, that's consent. If we say yes, it's consent. If we say disapprove, we have to give the amendments that would allow us to remove our reasons. You know, it's like, for our disapproved vote. So there isn't a scenario where it's like, yeah, no, we're saying no to this thing. And my general sense is no. I think, like, and I appreciate where you're coming from, because you obviously support the project, but I also think there's an element of if you vote yes, that's also telling the project, like, yeah, the way that this is designed is a okay. And I think there maybe are some issues that are. I mean, depending on what it is, it's like, could be anti displacement, which isn't directly related to municipal consent. Could be some design things that we're going to discuss. But, yeah, I mean, anyway, that's another way of thinking.
Speaker D:
Yeah. We got to remember the gravity of this project and how it's going to impact Robinson residents. And I encourage everybody to continue to challenge this project team we can't assume what they say or tell us is not that they're necessarily lying, but are misleading us, but we know what's best for our community and they're proposing things. It doesn't mean it has to be that way. So I just, I think we have to be okay, challenging, and I think by saying no, it does that says this is how we think the project should exist.
Speaker B:
That's fair.
Speaker A:
I think, you know, part of this ongoing discussion we've been having is.
Speaker G:
Yeah.
Speaker A:
I think related to wanting to maintain a consensus with a council so staff has direction on what to do. And, well, I support, like, efforts to elevate over the county road. That was, you know, part of that discussion, too. Last time was we weren't, you know, you're kind of playing around with this fourth option. And so in my mind, that's kind of what my ideal was for this. Right. Because he kind of has the best of both worlds for me. And so it's, you know, it is frustrating that we couldn't do that. So I think where I'm at is just, yes, the project, I don't necessarily know if I have to agree that this is how I would design it. I don't think I should be designing it for one. It's not going to be a good, it's not going to be a good outcome. But I just think that stalling this further, which I don't know how long that would be, if there is a no vote, I don't know if that's. It's complicated, for sure, and I apologize for not having a more articulate response, but I just, I think we would really benefit from this project. So it's tough. It's tough for me to say no on kind of just because no means no.
Speaker D:
Well, potential consolation is supposed to open in 2022.
Speaker F:
Right.
Speaker D:
And, I mean, there's, I would argue there is no transit emergency that says that we should give up design or give up anything that's going to be detrimental to rob results to make this project happen. It's going to be, I'm not going to repeat myself, but the most expensive, the largest infrastructure project ever wraps up today and for quite some time. And I just think we should just do it. I think it's our obligation to make sure it's done right.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
Well, if it makes you feel better, the other cities are going to say no, too, so we're not going to really be, I mean, Brooklyn park may be saying yes, for sure, but Minneapolis probably say no because they've got all things to change, by the way, if they get a subway under the parkway for the park people, then we should have a subway through Robinsdale. So maybe that should be because I don't trust that part of it. But we're not going to delay this by saying no. And I'm not telling you how to vote. We're not going to delay this by saying no. Here's our conditions, because at least for sure, crystal's going to do this also. I don't want it to delay. It's going to inflate the cost. I started working on this in 1985, so, yeah, I don't want it to delay, and I don't want to put the vote off to the next people. I mean, this is what we were elected to do. With regard to the parking ramp, I remember what Richard said and what Tim said, like, if there's no parking ramp, people are going to find a place to park in my neighborhood. And so I think we got to have a parking ramp. It's just got to be the right size. I don't know what the right size is, but they started out with 800, 500, 300 seems okay to me. I mean, if we put a number on it, that's a thing we can negotiate later. But one of my conditions is that you said in your plan that the parking ramp is here. That's where it should be. That's a condition to me. And they have operand and they're talking with you as plank now, probably, you know, so, and then the other things. It would be kind of cool if we had a little extra thing that said two of us wanted this and three of us wanted that. Like, I really think they should draw where there's going to be turnstiles for the future because it's going to happen just like in St. Louis. But I'm not. That's not a thing I'm going to fall on the sword for. I mean, it's just something I think we should do and I think we should limit these, like you all seem to be saying, you know, but the turning in on the left turn lanes for the. Both people, I think that's important. Both of them.
Speaker C:
Yeah.
Speaker G:
Thanks.
Speaker C:
I wanted to respond to what you were talking about earlier and just to share that, I think I share a lot of the same kind of, like, grappling through the decision making. And I think an unfortunate side effect of all of the attention on this project has sort of led to this belief that the vote is tied to your support or not support of light rail in general or the project in general, and that's become very real, I think. And. But I, you know, I'm with you in terms of being supportive of the project in a larger sense and feeling that the responsibility to the folks who voted me in as well. I know we were talking to the community about this during our campaigns around the same time, so I share a lot of that with you. But I think, what if it's helpful when I think about voting no with conditions, at the very least, it will provide awareness, and at most, it will continue the conversation with the project team so that we can make clear the things that are important to us, whatever the outcome is. I think, through some of the materials given. It's a long shot in some sense. But, yeah, I just wanted to say that I share a lot of those thoughts, too.
Speaker E:
Thank you. So, I think, from my perspective, a perfect world, which doesn't sound possible right now, would be to get the project to agree what we're asking for and then be able to vote yes, but they're not meeting us there. And so I think part of that is reserving this idea of know, not that it's set in stone. Like, I'm just gonna vote disapprove no matter what, but the idea that, like, we are asking for these things, and you. We didn't get the answer that we wanted, and so then we have the option to disapprove. And I think, like, a bigger picture, less about voting yes or disapprove or no consent, is just. I have been on the community advisory committee working with the project for the last. Almost three years now. Yeah, like, over that. And what I will say, that's hopefully some helpful perspective is just that they are very focused on getting light rail built, which, like, I can totally appreciate because that's what they're there to do. But they don't necessarily catch all the nuance of, like, what's happening in Robbinsdale and the feedback that we get, which I've tried to share, both on the positive side of things, when people are excited about stuff that they've released, but also some of the negatives that people share and that they're frustrated. And not just, like, we don't want this to happen, but that, like, this is concerning or that is concerning, like, the specifics of different, you know, different opinions on what is the issue. And so I will say, just in these calls, they do make statements where they don't. They're going through their process, but they aren't understanding the nuance of Robinsdale and what this means to our community. And so I do, like, if you listen to the calls, I tend to push back a lot because it's like, yeah, I get that you went through the process on environmental impact and you found that there were no severe impacts in Robbinsdale for noise, but, like, you're building a station right outside someone's house. So, like, what's the mechanism to account for that? And so, like, from their perspective, we went through our process and we did our thing and we gave that feedback and that's the result. And it's like, I think part of the interaction or where I've felt helpful or just like, you know, I'm trying to share the voices of Robinsdale is pushing back on some of those things that they just say, like, yeah, we did our thing. This is our process, and this was it. And this is where we're at. Or even just like, we heard feedback in general about this and it's like, yeah, but in Robbinsdale, that means something different. So that isn't to say, like, you should vote yes or no. I think it's just hopefully helpful context, because I do meet with the project team every month, if not more than that. So I wanted to get that perspective. And then another thing, just because we've been talking about the parking garage. So one thing that I've been thinking about, and this is sort of, again, wanting to confirm that as much as we can assume that that is part of this municipal consent vote, but as it relates to the parking structure, that they should include some type of substation that includes metro transit police. I think it's something we definitely should ask for. I know that there are issues around staffing levels for every police force in the metro right now, but to put that in our list of asks because, and I talked to Chief Foley, just the idea that we're. There's going to be impacts to our community on some level. There are already questions around jurisdiction, and I think it would be really helpful for them to ask for a metro transit police staffed substation in that facility. I guess the worst they could do is say no. But if we don't ask for it, we're not going to get it. And I think it could be really helpful because otherwise, metro transit police, for the most part, are moving like they don't have. They wouldn't have a place in Robinsdale. And we know that our totals are short relative to fully staffed. And we also know, I mean, obviously the project says that they take safety very seriously and I'll take them at their word. But I almost, from my perspective, I want to, you know, assume the best, but prepare for the worst. If something. If something doesn't go the way that they have planned, which has happened, that we've got some contingency built into this thing. So I know it's sort of a sidebar to the whole, like, size and parking ramp and that whole thing, but I think if we're building that, which it sounds like they are, that we should ask for that in this list of things. So I don't know if that's, like, springing a big thing on everybody, but that's an idea that I had.
Speaker D:
That's a good idea. I think one of the things would be to ask for specific. I think we need to be more specific.
Speaker E:
Does anybody yak? Is there any feedback on that?
Speaker A:
I was just gonna see if you had any info.
Speaker C:
Yeah, I'd love to. To think about it a little bit more. But at first thought, I think, yeah, it could be beneficial and relevant to the design aspect. So, yeah, I can see your point. I want to think about it more.
Speaker F:
I don't have any problem asking for it. The memo of the police department talked about adequate cameras and safety and things like that. That particular thing that they talked about should be in there. That has to do with the station. We haven't talked about the Darth Memorial station, which they unilaterally changed with an agreement with Minneapolis, not consulting the mayor or the city manager to the Lowry station. They moved it. So, you know, I did write down on the letter. Council does not want a repeat of changes to the newly named and cited Lowry station without consultation with Robbinsdale city manager, mayor, and city council. With regard to Mia's point about anti displacement, if there's a. If. If you want something in there that we get a pro rata share of anti displacement resources. In other words, Minneapolis doesn't get the outsized on whatever metric we decide, or they decide because they are our big brother and they do what they want. They moved our station without even telling us. I think there should be some language in there that Robinsdale gets its pro rata and fair share of anti displacement resources. Those kind of just, like, slapshot things that I've heard here.
Speaker B:
So I think what we're.
Speaker A:
So it sounds like we just need. Well, yeah, we'll just need one resolution on a no. And I don't know if you have enough what you need for putting that together with the design related plans.
Speaker B:
I'll start with not to kiss on. I just want to compliment the group that not all of the councils along the court are able to have a conversation like this. So kudos to you guys. Nothing new here. You've got five very different visions of this thing that the consensus making should be noted. So kudos to you all. What I think would be helpful to frame up for next steps is it's not real romantic, but thinking in terms of language specific to a resolution where we start writing on whereas clauses. I think taking a few notes here, councilmember Wagner, to your point about wanting to be supportive but recognizing an opportunity, as folks have said, in different capacities to get the best project, whereas clause might state something along the lines we support good infrastructure, good transportation, but this, this is not that threshold. I think an example to the elevated component. Right. Aware as clause as to whereas for the last two years, we went through a study with HMTB that showed we could physically do it. Prior to that, we were told we could not a part of that. We were told that we'll show you how we will mitigate concerns related to pedestrian crossing, vehicle crossing, the high level of crossing at 42nd, including that of, you know, the volunteer public safety people. Public safety. So I don't want to say in those terms that the whereas clauses aren't going to say we don't support this because you didn't give us an elevated structure. It's because we've been asking about this thing, the parking facility. We don't feel we have adequate data to show the justification. Further to Jason's comment, I mean, this is something Sheila was talking about three years ago, that if they're going to put a parking structure, we got to have proper safety in here. So blending the two, that is, if it's a substation or if it cameras or if it's. She was big on lighting, we never got that far while she was still on board. But to answer your question, yeah, we've been talking about that. So it's not that we're adamantly opposed to any parking in Robinsdale, but thinking again, in those whereas closets. So that's what I'm. To your question, that's what I'm starting to hear. I'm starting to put these things together. There are some specific specifics that I want to ask the group to kick around a little bit more. Those are the first two that I'll start to draft up. I would like a little more feedback on the Maori station when we talk a public safety plan in general. One of the reasons we were a little vague with that. Again, that's a platform that's going to fall in five different jurisdictions. That's complicated. That's not to say that people aren't going to show up, but it's in Minneapolis, it's in Robinsdale, it's on the county corridor. It's in parts, district property. And the platform is operated by Metro Transit. Who's liability, who's responding, who's. It's complicated. Right. To me, operationally, that's something that needs to be figured out. And I think this goes, goes back to that. Is this a lines and lanes thing or is this a policy thing? So they may just come back and say, you know, it's a policy thing and it doesn't adhere to that. Now, again, an opportunity for council to include that is now, I think again, that Venn diagram of what we're going to send by way of municipal consent and potentially an MOU, that would be a good example. But like, when it comes to the Lowry, I don't know if you guys have the Lowry station, I don't know if you have more feedback. If you have specific feedback as to the downtown station, I think that would be helpful for us. I mean, those are a couple big ones. Richard from engineering, are there specific columns that you're wanting to hear at this point?
Speaker G:
No, I don't think. I mean, this is complex, you know, and pulling together the right verbiage to put before the council to express what everybody's thinking and what everybody wants for the city is going to be challenging. You know, at some stage, I think the city council is going to have to take a position on the elevation. I was just reading that legal advice we got which says, you know, we're not going to approve it. However, you know, if one of the things is that we ask for elevation, they can still look at it and go, no, we're not going to do it. And then, you know, we got no recourse after that. And if I was a betting man, I would say exactly that. They'd look at that and go, no, we don't think it's necessary. We're not going to do it. I, you know, I put a lot of money on that bet, but, um, you know, there's a lot of. And I don't know where some of these smaller things are going to fit in, whether they're going to be part of the actual resolution that gets made or are they going to be wrapped into mous or something, because, I mean, we've got lots of kind of issues that are floating around, but some of them get into the weeds. And I don't know that they should be necessarily in the resolution. You know, all that stuff about the cathodic protection and some of the enhancement.
Speaker B:
Things we're looking at and all that.
Speaker G:
I don't know where they will fit in regard to this whole process. You know, the big ticket items are certainly the parking ramp proposal. I think those left turns are a great example of what should be in there. County Road nine, you know, the work on County Road nine, you know, to jason's observation, I consider that the redoing of county road nine from County Road 81 to the west is a critical element of this project because the way they're going to muck up the traffic and the rest, it needs to be ameliorated. And that's the only way they're going to do that even further afield. Let the turn back for county road eight. I mean, how much do we push on that in the resolution? I don't know.
Speaker F:
That one they're going to do anyway.
Speaker G:
Well, they're pretty vague about it.
Speaker F:
Do we even care? I mean, we kind of care, but do we care? Well, then they want to do it because they want to get rid of the.
Speaker G:
I want to get rid of it and I'm happy to take it on.
Speaker B:
But I want money.
Speaker F:
Right. But that's one letter that they sent that said, we're going to talk about that in six years.
Speaker B:
I don't trust them.
Speaker F:
Yeah.
Speaker G:
You know, so maybe having something like that listed in the, in the resolution might kind of put our stake in the ground and say, hey, you know, we, we need this resolved.
Speaker B:
Yeah, I don't care if you think it's poor important.
Speaker G:
Well, I mean, they've been sitting on that road for 80 years and collecting 80 years worth of state aid and they've done absolutely nothing to it.
Speaker F:
Yeah.
Speaker G:
So I don't know that there's any real pressing engineering type things. I mean, there's been a lot of discussion about the main elements and I think that's entirely appropriate. It's just going to be a case of deciding what should go in a resolution versus what should go in an MOU. Filtering that out, maybe the resolution states, and the city council wants to enter into an MOU with the project office regarding the following elements.
Speaker B:
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
Speaker G:
I don't know, there might be a way to address that. Oh, yeah.
Speaker A:
I was just gonna say, do we want to talk about the.
Speaker B:
Lowry considerations?
Speaker A:
And then also maybe the north memorial stuff?
Speaker E:
Are we ready to go there?
Speaker A:
I don't know what you want to add.
Speaker E:
Well, so in our last CAC meeting, which was like a week ago, I guess, I don't know, first Wednesday of the month. Was that last Wednesday? I can't even keep track of what's going on. Anyway, Nick Thompson, who was the project lead, made an interesting comment because we specifically were talking about the municipal consent process, and he said something to the tune of, you know, municipal consent is not like, what does this station look like or where is it located? It's more along the lines of, do we want to station there? And so as it relates to the Lowry station, I'd be totally fine. Just, you know what? Let's not have one there. Let's not have that. We don't need a station there. Now, I don't know. That seems like a pretty extreme stance considering they've pushed pretty hard to keep a station there. But I get, I'd be curious to know if that's like, if he really meant what he said, that, like, we're trying to decide whether or not there should be a municipal consent, should there be a station like a Lowry station or not? Because I could really easily say, you know what? We don't need that. On the flip side, if that's not what he meant, and he was just using that as a hypothetical.
Speaker F:
He specifically said lowry station or.
Speaker E:
No, no, he was saying stations. He wasn't saying Lowry, he was just saying station.
Speaker F:
He wants another station, correct?
Speaker E:
Yeah. So he was talking about stations in general. Like, do you want the station? How do you want it designed? That's not part of municipal consent. Where do you want it located? Do you want it here or there? That's not part of consent. It's like the bigger picture of do you want this station or not?
Speaker F:
Yeah, well, he's not right about that.
Speaker E:
So I. And that was sort of my take, but it was a thing that he absolutely said on the call. So there's that. But I also sent a letter to the city council to consider the idea of moving that station in Minneapolis, given all the reasons, the jurisdiction questions, the, you know, the idea that, like, the park board is upset about it. I mean, I guess we could ask for a tunnel, but I think the very least, it shouldn't be in the parkway. And it makes the most sense since Minneapolis is wanting more stations, not less.
Speaker F:
Yeah, well, I'm not in favor of that. If we're going to have stations and we're going to have a light rail, I want them in Robinsdale, some of them, and north Memorial is our biggest employer. You know, people could go to the doctor, not to the ER maybe, but they know I want it in Robinson.
Speaker E:
But you still have access. I mean, the from. And I totally get your point, but even the downtown station, where it's at right now is a quarter mile from our downtown.
Speaker F:
Right.
Speaker E:
So it's not as though, like, we're building stations that are, like, right where they're supposed to be. We're building them a quarter mile away. That would be, you know, less than a quarter of a mile away from. I mean, I guess it depends on where they put it. On 81 in Minneapolis, I'm a worker.
Speaker F:
That goes to North Memorial. I don't want to walk a quarter of a mile. I want to walk less. Well, there's a. There's going to be so many people.
Speaker B:
That go to that.
Speaker F:
Workers that go to that station. It should be right there. That's just my opinion.
Speaker E:
Yeah, no, and that's a valid point. I think it's worth a discussion, is. I guess my take is, would anyone else support moving it in to Minneapolis or is there a place to move it? There's not really a place to move it further into Robbins Dale. You're in high vee.
Speaker F:
Or.
Speaker E:
You know what I mean? You're further away if you go into Robbinsdale. But I do think we should be asking to get it out of the parkway. Or I guess the other option would be a tunnel.
Speaker F:
Yeah, well, if the parkway gets a tunnel, we should get a tunnel on any one because the parkway has this outsized power. Part of the land that the parkway's voting on is Robinsdale land. And Richard did this calculation. About 3.9% of Robinsdale is owned by the city of Minneapolis, and that's the parkway. And I dare say if that was native american land, they would be consulting with the Native Americans about what we should be doing on the parkway. They never consult or rarely consult with us. And that's an arrogant big brother thing that they. So I don't trust Minneapolis, that they're going to look out for our. I love Minneapolis. It's a world class city. I go there for entertainment. I do not trust them as far as looking out for Robinsdale. They moved that station already with their big brother power, and we're the little sister without even telling the city manager that they were going to do that. And the Met counsel and the BLRT people went right along with that, so. And I don't, you know, I don't care if the train track traverses over park or property. What is that? I mean, if you go there right now or you go there exactly 12 hours from now, you will see nobody there on that place. There's hardly anybody there. And when they go, they, they walk across it. They don't picnic at that area, they bike across it. It's not a burden to them to have a train go across there. I went down there one day and I saw North Memorial. They hired this Kinley whoever to do a video of that intersection. So we should be asking North Memorial. I just happened to go there when they were setting up. We should be asking North Memorial. What did you find out in your video? They were using this video to see where and how often emergency vehicles arrive and what the. So, but I'm not, I'm just one vote. You're one vote, but I say it stays in Robinson. If we're going to have all this, let's serve our people. And, you know, there's a component of the people that are saying move it down into Minneapolis. There's a component that I'm worried about of get those people out of Robinsdale. You know, I'm not saying that you think that, but I've detected a component of the people saying that, that are saying get those people out of Robinsdale.
Speaker E:
So in connected, is it okay?
Speaker A:
I don't know if anybody else is right now.
Speaker F:
So go ahead.
Speaker E:
So I guess the, I. You're making a valid point. I'm totally open to where would we, if we could move it further into Robinson, where would we move it? So it's not that, I'm just saying let's put it in Minneapolis and be done with it. So we're like, if we could move it out, where would we move it in Robinson? I don't know that there's an option for that. But the other thing that I will say to your point is it isn't just the train going through the parkway. It's a station that's in the middle of the parkway. So that is the component. I'm not necessarily complaining about like trains are going to go through the parkway. I'm saying the station being in the middle of the parkway is the component that I think has me most concerned. As far as you know, I mean, I run on the parkway multiple times a week. It's like you get train, you know, you're gonna have trains and bells and the whole deal. You've got the park board that is feeling unhappy about that. North Memorial is not happy about that. Based on the letter that, you know, what they wrote in the letter. So there's. It's. There are definitely constituents that live in ward two that are not. That live on the parkway, that are not happy about a station going in. In the middle of the parkway. But it's not just them. It's like all the other stakeholders that are involved in this, too, including the hospital, the park board, like responsibility around police and incidents. So I. I think there's an. From my perspective, there's just an issue with the Lowry station. I don't know how we specifically address it. And I. And I think you have good points.
Speaker F:
Well, you and I don't make the decision. What are the rest of us think?
Speaker D:
Well, I mean, it is concerned that North Memorial didn't. I think their letter was nicely put. I don't think they really support it. Park board. It's interesting.
Speaker B:
I haven't really told you.
Speaker D:
There's a lot of. Sit down there. It does make sense. Like, maybe push it back to Minneapolis where it seems like there's more room. But again.
Speaker B:
I don't know if that's.
Speaker D:
That one's just been kind of thrown at us because it was elevated and it's not elevated. The letter that. Talking to my copad, they are not happy about it at all. They don't see it as a benefit, really. I think they said 5% of employees use transit, and that's not to say that all 5% light rail. But I don't.
Speaker B:
That's something. I don't feel strong, one or the.
Speaker D:
Other, but it's concerning. I mean, you eliminate it, you know, their travel time is better.
Speaker F:
Yeah, they would be. But clearly Minneapolis doesn't really care about travel times.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
So you want another station?
Speaker D:
I kind of want to move it. Just because they moved it.
Speaker E:
I don't know.
Speaker D:
What do you guys mean?
Speaker B:
If I could.
Speaker C:
The only thing that I do feel strongly about this is not removing it from. Not removing the stop altogether. I think it is one of the benefits of the new alignment from when it was on the BNSF, that it's actually serving the hospital. So I feel strongly about that. In terms of the exact placement I mentioned before, the thing that I care about along the entire alignment is with cycling and pedestrian safety. And when I think about, like, I also bike the parkway, too, and I think about that intersection as being like, you're either going down the parkway towards, like, Golden Valley, or you're going down victory memorial. And it's kind of this disjointed. Like, if you're going all the way through, it's a bit disjointed. And it's the same thing that a lot of folks say about trying to cross 81. So by having a station in that area, there is the benefit of, like, improving overall cycling and pedestrian safety. So I see that as a benefit and a lot of the same things you were talking about with the safety, with the parking. I know we've talked about lighting and making sure things are safe for folks, especially at night and in the winter. So that's my few cents. But I feel pretty strongly about not removing that stop.
Speaker A:
I don't know how you can get it closer to Robinsville, but it should be as much into Robinsdale as possible, in my opinion.
Speaker D:
I think.
Speaker A:
Yeah, for all the reasons that other people have said, I agree with.
Speaker F:
Well, maybe we do agree that we think that there needs to be a better definition of how, where exactly it's going to be cited and how pedestrian, how public safety, including pedestrian and bicycle safety, is going to be handled. Because they don't have any drawings on a per limited basis, do they? How that works.
Speaker E:
There is one pedestrian function, maybe not necessarily where the station sits on the crosswalk, I think is in that picture.
Speaker F:
It is?
Speaker D:
I think so.
Speaker F:
All right, well, we can still ask them to do it better, I mean, because we don't know. And we can leave open the option of tweaking the sighting. But I would strongly say keep it in Robbinsdale, at least half of the platform or whatever. And you know what? If you just would take a dartboard and pick out ten times tomorrow, ten random times tomorrow, when you would stand at that corner, I'll bet you nine. But probably ten of those times, nobody's going across there walking or biking. I mean, of course there's going to be conflicts, but there just not that much. And Mia's correct. I mean, it can actually be an improvement to the. Whatever.
Speaker D:
Nia, you brought it up. And you kind of brought it up, too. North Memorial doesn't support it. You feel like this serves North Memorial. Is that just your general opinion that just makes sense to have there because.
Speaker B:
North Memorial doesn't support it?
Speaker C:
I don't know. I hear that certain representatives at the North Memorial might not support it, but I'm thinking about the population of who might be using it to go to work and it might be hourly workers who might not get a voice in the conversations on whether or not they want it. And that's who I'm thinking would be benefiting from transit ticket to work or to get to get care.
Speaker D:
So that's a question that should be answered.
Speaker B:
Right.
Speaker D:
Like, I bring the great point I've asked for this before is like, if we're going to have this station, you know, justified its use, I mean, do we know who, you know, what have we talked to the employees that would use this to and from work or patients? I mean, to me, that's just odd that that information has not been available or even looked at to justify it, because, I mean, it makes sense in my mind. Like, okay, yeah, patients want to give it, but will they, will they just take a bus? Will they continue to drive like we normally do?
Speaker B:
Whatever.
Speaker D:
But I mean, don't you agree that's information that's pretty important that we should have and then not just assuming.
Speaker A:
Yeah, I mean, I think with all of the ridership information, it's all speculative, regardless. If you, because if you ask, if you ask Joe the janitor if he's going to take it and he says yes, he might not, or he says no, but then he might want. Stop, she's there. So I think to me, I don't put as much weight on that as you probably could surmise on that other people do, just because again, if we think about it from a consumer item or like microeconomics or whatever, the product is not there, so we don't have any supply. So there's no way to measure demand yet in my mind. But I also think that I want it in Robinsdale for a variety of reasons. To north. Yeah. And I live over there, too. Right. Yeah. And. But a lot of my neighbors that are supportive of the project would like to be able to use it. And it's.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker A:
So I don't. It's serving the hospital, certainly, but it's also serving the neighborhood as well, the residents.
Speaker B:
I think the community has probably been.
Speaker D:
Accounted for, but when you have an entity like north, do you think you'd have a little more information on who? And I disagree. I think if you ask an employee and see if they're going to use it, it's a good indication that they're going to use it. They say no, you know, they probably won't because of, for whatever reason, but at least it'd be nice to know. I mean, it'd be no different than, I mean, nobody makes a product or.
Speaker B:
Builds something or goes into business without.
Speaker D:
Trying to figure out demand. That's just a smart business. So I'm just, I'm just curious. That's what I'm saying is that we can't just assume it sounds like a good idea.
Speaker A:
It doesn't mean it is a good idea.
Speaker D:
Like, we need to challenge some of these things or continue to challenge.
Speaker F:
And.
Speaker D:
That'S, like, our goal. It's not being abrasive or whatnot. I don't mean to come out abrasive. I'm just like, it's as representatives of Robinson businesses, we're the ones that have to ask these difficult questions because the residents aren't. Sorry, Jason.
Speaker A:
Yeah, well, I just wanted to say, too, that. So I guess just to clarify what you're saying, councilmember Murphy, do you want.
Speaker B:
The.
Speaker A:
Are you kind of saying what Jason's saying, like, get rid of it or push it into Minneapolis or.
Speaker D:
No, I'm just, it's just more conversation. I'm kind of like before, I'm kind of indifferent, but I just step back, everybody, and look that there's a park. Lord North Memorial has concerns. Those are the two biggest stakeholders for that area. You know, is there something else we should be looking at that's, you know what I mean, versus just kind of our personally want to have that there. And I understand why.
Speaker B:
I'm just trying to be objective about it.
Speaker D:
I really have brought it up. I wouldn't.
Speaker B:
Jason.
Speaker E:
So I'm wondering just in the spirit of, like, pushing for more and just ask. I mean, it sounds to me like the general consensus is, like, we want something to be there. Nobody feels strongly the way that I do that it should not be there or that it should leave the parkway. But one thing we could ask for is just to say, like, let's make it a tunnel. Like, we can have a station there. We can have it all underground. It meets your needs. I think it satisfies some of the questions that I have as far as, like, the aspects of this being a park and using it as, you know, as a green space. And, I mean, I guess in my mind, it doesn't hurt anything to say, like, hey, let's, we want that to be a tunnel, and that way we get the station there. It's underground. It's not visible. There's still access for North Memorial. There's still access for bikes and, and for everybody that uses the parkway the way that it is now.
Speaker B:
That would.
Speaker E:
Solve a lot of issues, even if.
Speaker D:
It'S sort of high with that baby underground, you have stations all over the place. It doesn't matter.
Speaker A:
I mean, so do other council members want to include that? I don't know. I feel like, I mean, if it's gonna, if no is gonna pass, then, I mean, why not? I suppose. But at the same time, like, I'm not an engineer. Like, I don't know what underground is better. Like the tunnel is better at grade or whatever. I know there's been some talk about, you know, as long as people with like, like accessibility, you know, considerations, as long as, like the tunnel doesn't hamper that. I think that's one thing with elevating it. Elevating the station is an added thing. You have to have elevators and escalators and stuff. So as long as it's accessible, I don't, I guess I don't really care if it's underground or nothing.
Speaker G:
But Richard, you're not going to get it underground.
Speaker F:
If we had to spend 20 million on that tunnel there or whatever, I'd rather spend the 20 million on our elevated situation than the 20 million for a tunnel right there and just making up numbers. Yeah, and they're not going to do it.
Speaker G:
There's too much infrastructure. There's no way what they would do is offer up instead of a tunnel, they'd put it at the same level as the road. That would be a simple solution, but.
Speaker F:
Then that, would that be good for a handicapped person or not?
Speaker G:
Well, I mean, whichever way you do it, whether it's underground or above, you know, elevated, at that point you're going to have to have some provision for access challenge foe.
Speaker F:
But the good thing about street level is you just roll up to there. You don't go in an elevator or whatever. It's not a big deal to me. But if they get a tunnel, we should get a tunnel right through. I'd like it to be tunneled all through our whole city, but it's too expensive. I understand that.
Speaker G:
You stop getting crystal light.
Speaker F:
Right. They do it under the, under the bay in Washington, DC or under the Potomac. It's too expensive.
Speaker C:
I don't feel strongly about it being underground. And I, part of what's balancing that is, I think with using this mechanism of disapprove in order to get the best design is I think there's a balance that we need to walk and be reasonable too with like if we're putting it elevated, but then we also want an underground that I think that also has optics and a perception that it won't come off as being reasonable.
Speaker B:
That's a good point.
Speaker D:
Where would it, Richard, elevate. Where would it start.
Speaker G:
For downtown?
Speaker D:
If we were to elevate it through.
Speaker G:
Downtown, it would start just immediately. Normal 40th.
Speaker B:
There was some question about functionality. We just got this video. I know people want to look at it or not. I didn't want to interrupt the good discussion. It's just a private station. Minute clip here. They've done some modeling. See how choppy this shows up.
Speaker G:
Watch out for the person doing yoga stretches.
Speaker D:
So what direction are we going?
Speaker F:
Are we heading towards Robinsdale?
Speaker B:
So right now, the bridge in front of you is 81. That's the new bridge.
Speaker G:
You're on the parkway going north in.
Speaker B:
The horizon would be sort of Minneapolis, and to the left would be Robinsdale.
Speaker F:
Are you doing that?
Speaker B:
It's a manual. Well, I thought you were pretty talented. And it's really hard to tell what's going on. Yep. So now this is starting to hook back north.
Speaker F:
And this.
Speaker B:
Yeah, this will come up to Lowry and we'll show you kind of the next intersection. This is now on the east side of 81.
Speaker D:
These are passive.
Speaker B:
That's right.
Speaker E:
Yeah, yeah. This is closest to, like, how it is right now.
Speaker D:
How do I see?
Speaker G:
So that apartment there is where the bridge currently stops. And they have to extend it.
Speaker F:
Have they extended it in that video?
Speaker G:
They have, yes. That's the one pier that doesn't look like the others. That one right there, the one that's.
Speaker B:
Next to the left, the one with.
Speaker F:
The two horrible in there, tucked in here.
Speaker G:
So that one there, you can see that that's the current abutment that they have for that bridge. So they just kind of modify it to make it a double abutment and then carry the bridge further south.
Speaker F:
They make it look very light and airy in that picture.
Speaker D:
Thanks for sharing that.
Speaker B:
All right, what else we got?
Speaker A:
So, yeah, I mean, the helipad, do we want to. I mean, it seems. I don't know if the hospital is. Let's see, what was it? I guess it's in there. Steve, comment. So I don't know if they're asking the city to do anything when it comes to that. What do you feel? I mean, no one from the hospital has asked me to advocate for anything, so I'll take some of your guys guidance, considering that. Yeah.
Speaker D:
Senate lenders.
Speaker B:
Yeah. So again, the reason I gotta ask for a bit more formal feedback. North Memorial has been involved to a degree, but more intentional, certainly in the last few months. This is their feedback from probably the most robust meeting we've had. And that was two, three weeks ago in response to. So this kind of gives you. This is more of a. Give you a flavor of what's on their mind. Oh, I see. But to your point, they have been certainly invited if they want to come and address counsel and give direct feedback. Just haven't taken us up on that yet.
Speaker A:
Do they know about the 21st?
Speaker B:
Absolutely.
Speaker H:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
So they're, you know, their person that deals with public relations. Visa de government. Like Opat was much more. This is anybody really? He's meeting with me tomorrow. It sounds like he might have talked to Regan. I mean, maybe he's going to talk with all of you. It'd be kind of silly to talk to me. I view the helipad thing as saying this is kind of cool. We could get a free relocation of our helipad. I mean, I don't know that that's our thing for our city to be insisting upon. I think we should take note of their part of the light of the letter that says hospital lighting, camera surveillance, platform safety, and regular metro transit police visits should be included in the design and operating plan. I think that's a city thing. And. Yeah, and then they're concerned about the roadway was their emergency landing site, and that's going to be taken away now, maybe. How many emergency landings of helicopters have there been in the last 2030 years? Yeah. Right. So, I mean, that's a consideration, but it's not like a thing that rises to the top of my, anyway, so to the extent that's related to the city and we should support them, but, yeah, getting them to have a free relocation of their helicopter.
Speaker B:
That'S kind of.
Speaker A:
Where my head was at as well.
Speaker F:
Going back to Mia, too. The more you ask for, the more you dilute your own stuff.
Speaker B:
All right.
Speaker A:
So anything else that we want to cover on this agenda item, the last.
Speaker B:
One I'll maybe throw again, if there is feedback on the downtown station, you know, I think we. That's maybe a better example of where we've gone back and forth and we've seen some adjustments that council and staff have advocated for, you know, in part recognizing the potential potential for an elevated structure, putting itself, also putting itself to better serve Robbinsdale residents. Get a lot of multi unit housing to the south. Better access that way plays into some of our longer term housing goals, including redevelopment sites. But to Jason's point, right, there's a, with any of these things that we advocate for, there's a counter. So immediate access to downtown, you're a little bit further away, but you're closer to more Robinsdale residents. But that's, again, the result of extensive conversation with council over the last maybe 18 months. But if there is feedback again right now with the station at Florida, this would be a good time to capture that one.
Speaker F:
Well, I thought it should be at 41st, and they convinced me to put it at 40th. But now they shouldn't be able to unilaterally flip it to the north part of the intersection at 40th. We should be telling them that it's on the south at 40th. I mean, they may put it to the north side of 40th just to say, oh, now we can't elevate. I would be suspicious of that.
Speaker A:
Yeah, I mean, I've always.
Speaker E:
Rick who.
Speaker A:
Ed or made that point, that should be serving residents, and there was just more residencies. Yeah. In the 40th area. So I think I'm still of that mind and still support that analysis.
Speaker B:
So.
Speaker A:
Thoughts, Councillor Murphy?
Speaker D:
Yeah, I don't know. It seems like it makes sense to buy downtown, but I get it.
Speaker B:
Jason.
Speaker E:
So in advocating for the residents of ward two who live over in that area, specifically closest to Crystal Lake and Lake Curve Drive, they've definitely strongly voiced the opinion that they would rather have it north of 40th. I don't know how that impacts the rest of the project. That eliminates the ability to elevate, but I just want to make sure it's known that that is highly. You know, they really dislike that location of that station. And I can understand why.
Speaker F:
Would it be fair to say that these residents won't support the project if it goes north of 40th?
Speaker B:
Also.
Speaker E:
There'S definitely contingency in there that they don't like this project no matter what. But there are some that are fine with light rail and transit, and it's just the idea of it being right outside the front door, within, you know, I mean, you're talking feet away.
Speaker D:
Is there issues with it being on the north side?
Speaker B:
So when we talk about it first, going to the north eliminates the possibility for elevated structure. Part of the study we did with HMPB proved that engineering could be done to accommodate this. We also, staff advocated that putting itself better serves, although the multi unit house we've got, you know, whether it's a block, whether it's two, and, you know, this includes apartments on Broadway harbor as we've got more further south. So one of the things you'll recall when we went through the stationary study with Bolton Mink Council made a priority wanting to serve Robbinsdale residents. We recognize this as a regional project, but advocating for the residents as best we can. And that did happen.
Speaker D:
I mean, I'll be honest, I think going from here to here is not gonna. Is not detrimental to still serving that. I think if it's here, you know, that makes a difference. But having it here is not going to, in my opinion, be detrimental to those residents and access to it, like structurally or anything else, like traffic wise, like Richard, was there any other issues? I'm just saying, let's say they don't want to elevate, then do we consider. And then it's right next to the proposed parking ring.
Speaker G:
Well, I think from the staff's perspective, we preferred it on the south side because it was closer to the naturally affordable housing that's kind of in that area.
Speaker D:
Right. But beyond that, because it's moving it on the other side of the road is not. I have a hard time believing it's.
Speaker B:
Going to do something well, but now.
Speaker G:
You'Ve got to cross another major intersection.
Speaker B:
To get to the station.
Speaker D:
One of the things we talked about.
Speaker B:
I'll say one of the things we talked about right away, acquisition to the. Whatever side it's going to be on is going to be more. We need more space. So on the south, there's going to be more right way acquisition right now. So that could potentially be to the detriment of, say, elm if they want to do a problem. We don't know what that that's true or not. That's potential. The same would have those adverts on the us bank site, and that includes a parking structure, and a big part of that is access. When we as staff are talking about access to a parking structure, we highly, highly drilled home the importance of maintaining access. Off 81, we've seen versions from the project office that if it is to the north, it limits turning lanes and will push more traffic on the Broadway, the 41st. So now you're accessing the parking structure, and it's especially concerning for us if people are coming from the west on 42nd, turn down either Humber or Broadway, and then access hubble Broadway. Some will absolutely do that.
Speaker D:
What if the parking grad isn't.
Speaker B:
That's a good question. You know, I don't know. The alternative defense of an appetite for Elam. We've seen, I mean, several proposals. There was one across the alley appeared, taking away the pizza shop at one point. So that would you start the process over altogether?
Speaker F:
So I think, in conclusion, there's good reasons to keep it from the south, especially the turning into the parking ramp and making it convenient for people. As an aside, in Brooklyn park, they did this, and Jeff Lundy knows that they watched some places and then residents sold them. The Met transit claims that you're most about 10%. So those people that are just like white on this shouldn't be in our letter, but this is a thing to remember in the future, and Jeff Lundy is sort of amenable to that. Those people that are right on the corridor, some of them, they should buy those people's houses and then they can resell it to people that know and they'll get 10% more. And so they can then resell it to people that know that they're right there. That's a little thing that you can think of later. He said they did that and didn't work somewhere.
Speaker B:
So.
Speaker A:
I guess I are reading. Are you okay with.
Speaker B:
The original one?
Speaker C:
Yeah, I'm good with that.
Speaker B:
So.
Speaker A:
I think that's the majority. I mean, unless I'm mistaken. So I don't think we proceed with that usual.
Speaker B:
So correct me if I'm wrong. What we will do, I'll still write two burdens of resolution, one with consent, one outlining what we've discussed today. We can certainly workshop it works method in part, including the open house and public hearing on September 3, will occur before the work session on the 10th. But that's going to be the cutout when we need to take action.
Speaker F:
So the 10th is a council meeting or a work session.
Speaker B:
Work session. So at that work session, we'll discuss the two drafts.
Speaker F:
And you're going to give it to us ahead of time so we can nitpick it, get it back, get the quotation marks on the right side of.
Speaker B:
The commas and the periods. Criticize all of my semicolons, just those.
Speaker F:
Two that I found in here.
Speaker E:
Can I ask one more?
Speaker F:
We should show Heather. Show.
Speaker E:
So one thing that I was thinking about is that we know that there's three acres or so it takes in Robinsdale from this project of what? Of takes. So, like, land that the project is taking. Like, I think it's 3.1 acres. And just as it relates to route, I think. But I could be mistaken. I think it would make sense to ask for first rider refusal on any of that that's left over in this.
Speaker D:
Project.
Speaker E:
And then I guess the last. And so along with that, just asking from. So if us bank were to be redeveloped or just the tax, like what it is as a taxable property right now that we get taxes on because it's a private property, if you know. So at a bare minimum, we should be made whole on whatever that is for the US bank. But even thinking that, like, there's the idea that it could be something other than a parking lot, that could bring even more revenue in, like making sure that and again, this might be in the moe you, but like asking for making sure that we get that. But I think the right of first refusal makes sense in the actual municipal consent because it's relative to the route.
Speaker B:
So the couple different types of takings that they're projecting right now, one would be temporary construction and one would be permanent. The only parcel identified for a permanent taking as a us bank site. There's some right of way acquisition that they may take. And again, some of these properties, you can see on this map that it creeps into parking for Robin center, maybe the church. Whether or not that's just temporary or long term, hard to tell. There is, and we've talked about this like some good nuance in we. Correct me if I'm wrong here, Richard. We discovered through sort of poking around the city was turned back right away, access off of 81 in Robin center that we essentially licensed with them. So now that if that gives us, I don't know that it formally gives us like fee title, but that give us some jurisdictional authority. So maybe not a first right component, but those are the kinds of things that we're looking at.
Speaker E:
Yeah, I also, even if there's, even if there ends up being less than what they're saying, it also holds them accountable to, like, because, you know, these projects go, oh, well, actually we need this. So it's like, oh, okay, well, if you take that, anything that's left over, we get. I mean, again, I'm just trying to make sure we're like pretty protecting Robinsdale as much as we can, because if we don't ask for it, they won't.
Speaker B:
Give it to us.
Speaker F:
Yeah, that's a good idea. First rate of refusal.
Speaker A:
Why not?
Speaker B:
Cool.
Speaker A:
All right, any other thoughts, comments on that?
Speaker D:
Okay, great.
Speaker G:
Let's.
Speaker A:
And whenever you're ready for item four, a, whoever's taking the other understaff updates can go ahead.
Speaker B:
Yeah, so I've got one quick one pass around letter from the attorney. You'll recall we had a first reading, some recommended updates to charter, including the filling of the vacancy. So that first reading on July 16, we ran into specifically some concerns as to what officially triggers some of those provisions, some of which there was some vague language, and it made it difficult to hit that threshold. We've actually sort of dumb coincidence. I won't get into too far. There was a state supreme court case that was settled in between the time we had the first hearing and now. And this really gives us clear direction. And you can see the results from that here. By recommendations of the attorney in Columbia Heights, there was a council member, maybe not for the minutes. Rachel, start a thing. Conducted themselves in a way that was not professional, making some pretty disgusting phone calls to a candidate and then later blaming it on a niece. It just. Bill knows the case, so he knows I'm glassing over a little bit. Ultimately a recompetition. Washington started based on that, and the Supreme Court determined it did not meet the proper threshold, that the petition was not accurate. So what they ultimately did is said that in these circumstances, malfeasance, in part, has to be a part of your job as a council member. So you as a resident would be a complete jackass, but you as a council member, they have certain parameters which you have to operate. It also, again, through some statutory language, inciting a past case law, dialed in that the conduct of performance of an act by an officer in an official capacity that is wholly illegal and wrongful. So again, makes it more explicit. So we can't start a recompetition because you wore a red cap and I don't like red caps. All that said, the mayor had sort of called this out, maybe foreseen the future prior to this case being settled, that we had some pretty vague language in here. Really. Most of it's on page two of the memo. It's updating by way of taking away some of those vague considerations as to qualifications for recompetition, and then does add in some language specific to malfeasance. All that's to say, the second reading we're still planning on hosting next week, be a part of your packet. The last formal step of this, the charter commission meets tomorrow night, and so they will give kind of feedback on, if they maintain approval, they'll be able to. I just wanted to run through that real quick, because we did do that first reading. We did get approval to go. The second reading meeting, a part of the direction staff got was to get this dialed in just by way. Again, sort of dumb walk. I knew that case was pending. I lived next door to Columbia, so I was kind of curious what was going to happen with Katie. But this gives us clear direction, so I don't know if there's any questions on that. And we can certainly, I'll explain all this at the second. If there are questions, I'd be happy to jump into it.
Speaker D:
Sorry it has to meet all three of those. Three part test for not the all must be met. Well, what's interesting, so Bill brought this up before, is whatever conduct that is wholly illegal and wrongful, not guilty, of doing something illegal. So who determines if it's.
Speaker B:
Illegal or not?
Speaker F:
You know, when I read the case, the Supreme Court case, and it's nothing dense with legalese, I think if you read the case, which is not too long, you could see what they're getting at the Supreme Court, what they said you could and couldn't do. And talking to our attorney, Mary Teachin, well, I don't know if they talked to her after that, but reading the case, she. She clearly, throughout that number two and three that I was talking about, not necessarily exactly because of what I was saying, but because of what the Supreme Court said. If you got the case, I think that would be the best explanation of why that has to be out of there. And she's going to be at the meeting toward her.
Speaker D:
They'll ask her.
Speaker B:
She'll be at the charter meeting.
Speaker D:
Oh, the charter meeting.
Speaker B:
I'll let them figure it out.
Speaker F:
But the council should get the case. I mean, it's not that hard.
Speaker D:
In fact, that guy that started the recall reached out to me, asking people.
Speaker F:
How would you do it?
Speaker D:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
And their thing is, their recall provisions are very, very similar to ours.
Speaker D:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
But the ruling was done. You can't throw it off.
Speaker A:
Is there any other things under other.
Speaker B:
That's it for me. I don't know if any other staff has anything else.
Speaker G:
I just wanted to hand around some photos showing the commencement of the installation of the solar panels on the roof down the water treatment plant.
Speaker F:
If you give that to CCX media, that would be good, because I talked about that in the marriage minutes today.
Speaker C:
They're very interested in doing a piece.
Speaker B:
On the panels as they get installed.
Speaker F:
So, Richard, while these are going around and they're not taking up extra time, you said that about 11% of our electric bill would be paid on average by these solar panels. What is our electric bill from? What. Oh, gosh. I'm Brian.
Speaker G:
Happy to look that up. Okay. And then go through the monthly 200 page document we get from Xcel Energy.
Speaker F:
Because I'm thinking it's got to be at least $500 a month that we save, but at least in mind, I'll start that. Yeah, yeah, that's pretty cool.
Speaker D:
Anything on the wire tower lights?
Speaker G:
We're just going through the. We had to do a change order for the outside white lights because they weren't controllable. We're hoping that that'll get. And once I'm comfortable with that, we'll turn it back on.
Speaker F:
I can't remember who I got that charging and fueling infrastructure grant letter of support from sort of self explanatory. Where is it? It's self explanatory. I'm just hoping that people think it's good for us to support the infrastructure being supported the way it says. In that order.
Speaker A:
Yeah.
Speaker F:
Tangentially, we. I would like. We got $30 million of your guys budget. You've done a great job. Don't take this as an insult. We cracked up a car and it wasn't our fault. I would like us to get an electric vehicle this year. And I don't. I don't care if we have a supercharger. We can be just like me at my house. I plug it in. I've got a new car coming in a slow way. I see nods of the heads. So is that going to happen if.
Speaker B:
That was going on?
Speaker G:
Well, the recreation vehicle suffered a very ignominious end just last week, so they need to have that vehicle replaced, like, sooner rather than later. So I think Josh was going to look around and see what are the needs for the recreation department? Is there an appropriate electric vehicle available? We might have to go out and get prices from dealers rather than go through the government contract. Otherwise we'll be waiting forever. But if we get two prices from different dealers, we should be able to proceed with the purchase.
Speaker F:
The next item is.
Speaker B:
The letter. There is a due date of. I think it's the 19th, and that would fall before the next council meeting. So the mayor had shared it over. This can be executed and delivered council support. And then, Bill, you let me know if you want me to dress it up or if you want to dress it up.
Speaker F:
Just make it the way it is, and I'll look and see if there's any punctuations that we want. We can have the whole council sign it. Is that the way you're going to do it, or you're going to just have. I don't care.
Speaker B:
I don't know if I have stamps for everybody.
Speaker F:
However the council wants to do it.
Speaker B:
I didn't put names.
Speaker A:
I think otherwise, since it's kind of.
Speaker F:
Soon, it's just names with maybe script, like. Just like community gardens. I mean, you handled this community garden theft thing. It's just. And then there were some suggestions from some. Someone else of how they handled theft and the labeling of the gardens and stuff.
Speaker A:
This is a longer email, right?
Speaker F:
Right. I mean, this is a staff thing. I shouldn't be messing with it. I just felt really bad for these people that are spending all this time, and then there's theft of their produce. And so I think we should do what we need to do to limit that as much as possible.
Speaker B:
Yeah. Everybody know what we're talking about here? When Bill, or I guess we're all contact with Bill, head forward and asked to get it out. As noted, we've taken some steps to address. I'm not at a point of recommending installing an eight foot fence. That kind of goes against the access and inclusiveness that we built with thing for. But there are other ways. We're trying to go find better signage. Open ad. It sucks that this is a thing. It's a technical terminal. It sucks. So we'll continue. One of the things I share with the mayor, you know, that we've had a lot of success with. Unfortunately, the band got smashed up. We've been distributing fresh prone by poundage. A lot has gone out to section eight housing. So in that spirit, we're doing a lot of that kind of stuff. So we're continuing that name that if there is access for folks to help with that, maybe they'll help us do it.
Speaker F:
That's it. I don't want to take more.
Speaker A:
Does anyone else want to add anything? Well, thanks, everybody. We can.
Speaker B:
Yeah.
Speaker A:
We're going to be adjourned then.
Speaker B:
Don't forget, meeting on Friday at noon. Those are available. I need at least three of you there.
Speaker C:
Oh, you were not present when we set this. The canvassing board, can you make it?
Speaker F:
Yeah, and I will run out quickly. I have a closing at 1230 in.
Speaker B:
Minnetaka, so good incentive to get it done.
Speaker E:
Do I need to be there, Kim?
Speaker B:
You're welcome.
Speaker F:
You want to make sure we certify the right person?
Speaker D:
Yeah.
Speaker E:
I'll do some double checking.
